  This file may be \include'd in a score to provide the
  context structure for a score arrangement consisting
  of the following staves, although normally only a subset
  of these staves would be used in any one score.

  Solo Staff (outside Choir grouping)
  Descant Staff (within Choir grouping)
  Women Staff (single voice on one staff)
  First and Second Soprano (optionally on two Staves or one Staff)
  Soprano and Alto (optionally on two Staves or one Staff)
  First and Second Alto (optionally on two Staves or one Staff)
  First and Second Tenor (optionally on two Staves or one Staff)
  Tenor and Bass (optionally on two Staves or one Staff)
  First and Second Bass (optionally on two Staves or one Staff)
  Men Staff (single voice on one staff)
  Piano Staff

  It is intended primarily to hide the complexity of the context
  structure from newcomers to LilyPond, but is also useful as a
  shorthand for seasoned users.  It is intended to facilitate the
  setting of pieces in which different groupings of voices appear
  at different times.  All that is necessary is to populate the
  appropriate variables with music for the relevant sections and
  with rests elsewhere, with sections separated by line breaks.

  Usage:

  ssaattbb.ly should be included at the *end* of the input file. Before
  it are placed the required music and lyrics by redefining specific
  variables, like this:

  \paper { ... }
  \header { ... }
  Key = { ... }
  Time = { ... }
  SopranoOneMusic = \relative { ... }
  SopranoOneLyrics = \lyricmode { ... }
  SopranoTwoMusic = \relative { ... }
  SopranoTwoLyrics = \lyricmode { ... }
  AltoOneMusic = \relative { ... }
  AltoOneLyrics = \lyricmode { ... }
  AltoTwoMusic = \relative { ... }
  AltoTwoLyrics = \lyricmode { ... }
  TenorOneMusic = \relative { ... }
  TenorOneLyrics = \lyricmode { ... }
  TenorTwoMusic = \relative { ... }
  TenorTwoLyrics = \lyricmode { ... }
  BassOneMusic = \relative { ... }
  BassOneLyrics = \lyricmode { ... }
  BassTwoMusic = \relative { ... }
  BassTwoLyrics = \lyricmode { ... }
  PianoRHMusic = \relative { ... }
  PianoDynamics = { ... }
  PianoLHMusic = \relative { ... }
  TwoVoicesPerStaff = ##f (applies to all staves)
  \include "ssaattbb.ly"

  In addition, if there are sections in which two or more parts
  are in unison, the following variables may also be defined:

  WomenMusic = \relative { ... }
  WomenLyrics = \lyricmode { ... }
  SopranoMusic = \relative { ... }
  SopranoLyrics = \lyricmode { ... }
  AltoMusic = \relative { ... }
  AltoLyrics = \lyricmode { ... }
  TenorMusic = \relative { ... }
  TenorLyrics = \lyricmode { ... }
  BassMusic = \relative { ... }
  BassLyrics = \lyricmode { ... }
  MenMusic = \relative { ... }
  MenLyrics = \lyricmode { ... }

  All of the definitions are optional. Staves with no music will be
  omitted from the output.

  If TwoVoicesPerStaff is #f, music of the various voices may be
  placed individually on one or two staves according to the
  following variables, all of which default to #f:

  WomenTwoVoicesPerStaff
  SopranoTwoVoicesPerStaff
  AltoTwoVoicesPerStaff
  TenorTwoVoicesPerStaff
  BassTwoVoicesPerStaff
  MenTwoVoicesPerStaff

  Other variables, such as the instrumentName, shortInstrumentName
  and MidiInstrument can also be changed by defining variables like
  AltoInstrumentName, BassMidiInstrument, etc.  The prefixes for staves
  containing two divided voices are WomenDivided and MenDivided, etc
  hence the corresponding variables would be WomenDividedInstrumentName,
  etc.

  The key is defined in the variable Key, and the structure of time
  and repeats in the variable Time, using spacer rests.

  A \layout block may be defined in the variable Layout.  There is
  no default \header block and no default \paper block.

  Music may be tagged with #'print or #'play to be included only in
  the printed score or in the MIDI file respectively.
