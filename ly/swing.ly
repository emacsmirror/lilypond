%% Originally inspired by contributions to LilyPond issue #687
%% <https://sourceforge.net/p/testlilyissues/issues/687>,
%% especially by Dean Radcliffe <chicagogrooves_at_gmail_dot_com>
%% and Arvid Gr√∏tting <arvidgr_at_gmail_dot_com>.


%%% Usage examples:

%%   %% swung eigth or sixteenth notes
%%
%%   \tripletFeel 8 { c8 c }
%%   %% result: { c8*4/3 c8*2/3 },
%%   %% corresponding to \times 2/3 { c4 c8 }
%%
%%   \tripletFeel 16 { c16 c }
%%   %% result: { c16*4/3 c16*2/3 },
%%   %% corresponding to \times 2/3 { c8 c16 }
%%
%%   %% samba swing
%%
%%   \applySwing 16 #'(3 2 2 3) { c16 c c c }
%%   %% result corresponding to \times 4/5 { c16. c16 c c16. }
%%
%%   \applySwing 16 #'(4 3 3 4) { c16 c c c } % smoother
%%   %% result corresponding to \times 8/7 { c16 c32. c c16 }


%%% Known limitations:

%% * \repeat constructs in music (even \repeat unfold) are not taken
%%   into consideration when determining note timing. This will lead
%%   to problems unless the durations of all repeated parts are
%%   integer multiples of the swing cycle duration.
%%
%% * These functions are oblivious to time signatures and measures.
%%
%%   That is why offsets need to be supplied by the user if music
%%   starts off-beat.
%%
%% * Grace notes are ignored and simply left unaffected.
%%
%% * Treatment of notes shorter than swingDiv is ad-hoc and may not be
%%   what you want.
%%
%%   In some detail: \applySwing operates by shifting the boundary
%%   between two events if it falls on an off-beat multiple of
%%   swingDiv. Assuming forward shift (backward shift works
%%   analogously), this is done by first lengthening the earlier
%%   event, then shortening the following event(s) by the same amount.
%%
%%   Notes shorter than swingDiv never trigger the first step, hence
%%   all notes in the following examples remain straight:
%%
%%      \tripletFeel 8 { c16 c c c }
%%      \tripletFeel 8 { c16 c c8 }
%%
%%   However, if they appear after a note that has already been
%%   lengthened, they will be shortened in the second step. Therefore,
%%
%%      \tripletFeel 8 { c8 c16 c }
%%
%%   will result in timing corresponding to \times 2/3 { c4 c16 c }.

%%% Grid calculations

%% Assume we want to swing notes of duration s in cycles of n notes,
%% such that the i-th note in such a group gets a relative length of
%% wi, but the length u = n*s of the cycle as a whole remains
%% unchanged. This corresponds to a function call like
%%
%%   \applySwing s '(w1 w2 ... wn) music
%%
%% and means that we want to distort a "straight" temporal grid
%%
%%   0       s      2s       (n-1)s       u     u+s ...
%%   |  (s)  :  (s)  :     ...    :  (s)  |  (s)  : ... (periodically)
%%
%% to something like
%%
%%   0       s+d1  2s+d2    (n-1)s+d(n-1) u   ...
%%   | (w1)    : (w2) :    ...     : (wn) |   ...       (periodically)
%%
%% We can calculate the deltas di from the weights wi as
%%
%%   di = d(i-1) + (wi/W)*u - s
%%
%% with W = w1 + w2 + ... + wn. The function
%% calculate-normalized-deltas does this for the special case u = 1,
%% i.e. s = 1/n, working with rational numbers; calculate-delta-alist

%%% Putting things together

%% Now, a function call
%%
%%    (apply-swing s '(w1 w2 ... wn) start-time music)
%%
%% does the main work. It iterates over chords/notes/rests in music,
%% looking for boundaries between events that fall on a line of the
%% straight grid. If it finds such a boundary on grid line i, it will
%% attempt to move it by di (calculated as described above) as
%% follows:
%%
%% * Lengthen the event that ends on the boundary by di, unless its
%%   duration is shorter than swing-div.
%%
%% * Shorten the following events (durations: e1, e2, ... ej, ...) by
%%   at most di*ej/swing-div each until the lengthening has been
%%   compensated for completely.
