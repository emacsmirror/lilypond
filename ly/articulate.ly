%
% This script tries to make MIDI output from LilyPond a little more realistic.
% It tries to take articulations (slurs, staccato, etc) into account, by
% replacing notes  with sequential music of suitably time-scaled note plus
% skip.
%
% Trills, turns, mordents and pralls are expanded with rallentendo
% and accelerando taken into account.
%
% As my scheme knowledge is poor (I was teaching myself as I went), there
% is much scope for improvement.

% See: http://nicta.com.au/people/chubbp/articulate for additional
% information about how the articulate function works.

%%% Supported items:
% Articulations on a single note (staccato, staccatissimo, portato, tenuto).
% Slurs and phrasing slurs.
% Ornaments (i.e. mordents, trills, turns).
% Rallentando, accelerando, ritard and 'a tempo'.
%
% Please refer to 'MIDI output' (Section 3.5) in the Notation Reference
% Manual for a more detailed list of supported items.

%%% Technical Details:
% * Any note not under a slur or phrasing slur, and not marked with an
%   explicit articulation, is shortened by ac:normalFactor (default 7/8).
%   (Shortening a note means replacing the note with a note of a smaller
%   duration, and a rest to make up for the difference between the durations
%   of the original and the shortened note.)
% * Notes marked with articulations are shortened by factors specific to the
%   articulation as follows:
%     staccato       not under a slur: ac:staccatoFactor (default 1/2)
%                    under a slur: ac:portatoFactor (default 3/4)
%     staccatissimo  ac:staccatissimoFactor (default 1/4)
%     portato        ac:portatoFactor (default 3/4)
%     tenuto         ac:tenutoFactor (default 1/1 - by default, notes marked
%                                     tenuto are not shortened)
% * Appoggiaturas are made to take half the value of the note following,
%   without taking dots into account (so in \appoggiatura c8 d2. the c
%   will take the time of a crotchet).
% * Trills and turns are expanded. The algorithm tries to choose notes
%   within the time of the current tempo that lead to each twiddle being
%   around 1/8 seconds.
% * Rall, poco rall and a tempo are observed. It'd be fairly trivial to
%   make accel. and stringendo and so on work too.

%
%%%USAGE
% In the \score section do:
% \articulate <<
%       all the rest of the score
% >>
% or use the lilywrap script.
%
% TO DO:
%
% * Dynamics.
%   * Fix quantisation for dynamics on single note (replace note
%     with tied 128th notes?) -- started, needs work.
%   * Make \fp do the right thing (loud start, then quiet).
%
% * Inegalite.  Notes on-beat steal time from notes off-beat.
%   Degree of stealing is a parameter: from 1.0 (straight)
%   to 1.5 (extreme swing).  Also fix tenuto to use this.
%
% * add accel (to match rall), and molto rall. I've never seen
%   molto accel but some composer somewhere has probably used it.
%
% * Fermata, and Fermata Lunga
% * Add more synonyms for accel and rall: rit ritard stringendo
%
% * Phrasing.
%   * Rall at end of piece
%   * Very slight accel into a phrase, rall out of it.
%   * Dynamics during a phrase????  unclear how these should be in
%     the general case
%
% * Trill algorithm needs work.
%
% * Cope with more ornaments/articulations.
%    inverted-turns, etc.
%   -- accent needs better control of dynamics.
%   -- Handling of generic ornaments (in lily, `\stopped'; in
%               most early music:  ornament this note (trill, turn
%               or mordent as the player wishes))

% * Automatic gruppetto at end of trill; better handling of
%      initial/final grace notes on trill

% * Automatic ornaments.
%   * Spot cadences and ornament
%   * Look for quaver-dotted note for trills, for example.
%   * Fill in steps. (Needs lookahead/lookbehind.)
% * `afterturn' -- a turn after the start of a note.
% * accidentals for trills and turns

% CHANGELOG
%  * Heikki Tauriainen: handle also the \portato articulation (both as an
%    explicit articulation, and as the articulation to use for slurred
%    notes marked \staccato).
%  * David Kastrup: remove redefinitions of \afterGrace and \appoggiatura
%    and let their actions be performed when \articulate is called by
%    recognizing and replacing LilyPond's default code for these constructs.
%    Cf issue 4517 in LilyPond's tracker.
%  * David Kastrup: basic 2.15.28 compatibility by using event-chord-wrap!
%    This should really be done by rewriting the code more thoroughly.
%  * From Iain Nicol: appoggiatura timings were out; add staccatissimo; fix
%    trillSpanner endpoints.
%  * Also handle Breathing events (by throwing them away).  This isn't ideal;
%    one should really shorten the note before a little.  But I don't know
%    how to do lookahead in scheme.
%  * Also ignore explicit line breaks.
%  * Add Mordents (reported by Patrick Karl)
%  * Thomas Morley: extend unfold-repeats to reflect the possibility to
%    customize its effect to user-settable repeat-types. Here the most general
%    setting is hard-coded, resulting in unchanged behavior.
