/* Allow a bar number if any of these conditions is met:

   - there is a bar line,
   - there is a break point,
   - we are at the start of the piece.

   We must allow bar numbers at breaks without bar lines (created
   with explicit \break or \allowBreak) so that there can be a
   parenthesized bar number at the start of the line.  We won't know
   breaks until way later, so we need to create a bar number now.
   We must also allow bar numbers at bar lines without a break point
   since \noBreak should not influence bar numbers.  However, if we
   did nothing more, \allowBreak wouln't play well with

     \set Score.barNumberVisibility = #all-bar-numbers-visible
     \override Score.BarNumber.break-visibility = #all-visible

   as that will create bar numbers at all allowed break points.  The
   strategy here is that if a bar number was created only because a
   break is allowed and not because of a bar line, its only reason to
   exist is the break, so it shouldn't be printed if the break point
   eventually doesn't end up as a break.  Thus, we set the middle
   component of the resulting bar number's break-visibility to false
   in this specific case.

   In centerBarNumbers mode, the spanner will be automatically broken,
   so there is no need to restart a spanner at a break point without a
   bar line.  Nor should we do it, as it can't be suppressed with
   break-visibility. */
