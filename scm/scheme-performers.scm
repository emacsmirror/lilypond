This performer is intended for instantiation in @samp{Voice}-like
contexts.  The context variable @code{beatExtraVelocity}
is used for adding extra MIDI velocity at each beat (default 15) in
accordance with @code{beatStructure} and an additional
@code{barExtraVelocity} (default 10) at the start of each bar.

This is done by adding corresponding @code{\\accent} and
@code{\\marcato} events when such note events are encountered.

Off-beat manual use of @code{\\accent} or @code{\\marcato} causes
autogeneration of the next on-beat accent to be skipped.")))
