@item arrow-stencil
The stencil procedure for the @code{BendSpanner} arrow head.
@item bend-amount-strings
An alist with entries for @code{'quarter}, @code{'half}, @code{'three-quarter}
and @code{'full}, which are used to print how much a string is bent.
@item bend-arrowhead-height
The height of the arrow head.
@item bend-arrowhead-width
The width of the arrow head.
@item curvature-factor
Determines the horizontal part of a bent arrow as percentage of the total
horizontal extent, usually between 0 and@tie{}1.
@item curve-x-padding-line-end
For a broken @code{BendSpanner}, set the padding at the line end to subsequent
objects like changed @code{Clef}, etc.

For a broken @code{BendSpanner} started from a chord the curves don't match;
there is a certain vertical gap specified by this value.
@item dashed-line-settings
List of three numeric values representing on, off and phase of a dashed line.
@item head-text-break-visibility
A vector of three booleans to set visibility of the arrow head and the text at
a line break.  This is important for @code{'style} set to @code{'hold},
@code{'pre-bend} or @code{'pre-bend-hold}.
@item horizontal-left-padding
The amount of horizontal free space between a @code{TabNoteHead} and the
starting @code{BendSpanner}.

An integer used as a factor determining the vertical coordinate of the starting
@code{BendSpanner}.  If @code{successive-level} is@tie{}1, the
@code{BendSpanner} starts at the @code{TabNoteHead}.  If consecutive
@code{BendSpanner}s are set this value should be set to an appropriate value for
the first one; later on, this value is maintained by the engraver.
@item target-visibility
A boolean to decide whether the target @code{TabNoteHead} should be visible.
For up-pointing bends this is usually true.

Vertical padding between note heads and bends for @code{pre-bend} and
