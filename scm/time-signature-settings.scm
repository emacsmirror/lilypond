;;; specify time signature default settings

;;; format:
;;;
;;; alist of
;;;   (time-signature . default-properties) entries.
;;;
;;; where default-properties is an alist containing information about the
;;; time signature.  Each default-properties set can contain the
;;; following entries:
;;;
;;;   (beatBase . (/ numerator denominator))
;;;   (beatStructure . structure-list)
;;;   (beamExceptions . (alist of beam exceptions that don't follow beats))
;;;
;;; The alist of beam exceptions has the following entries:
;;;
;;;   (end . grouping-rules)
;;;   (subdivide . grouping-rules)  (not yet implemented, reserved for future use)
;;;
;;;   grouping-rules is an alist containing (beam-type . grouping-list) entries
;;;
;;;     beam-type is the length as a rational number
;;;     grouping-list is a list that specifies the
;;;     number of stems of the given duration that are grouped in a beamed unit.
;;;     For an exception, the duration used is beam-type.  For measureBeats,
;;;     the duration used is beatBase.
;;;
;;;     If an exception is specified for a given beam-type, it will apply to all
;;;     beams of shorter durations that don't have an individual exception, so
;;;     (1/8 . (3 3 2))
;;;     will cause all primary beams to be broken at 3/8, 6/8, and 8/8.
;;;
;;;     (1/32 . (16 8 4 4))
;;;     will cause all 1/32, 1/64, and 1/128 beams to be broken at 1/2, 3/4,
;;;     7/8, and 8/8.
;;;
;;;     Tuplets are referenced using their actual (scaled) length, so
;;;     a 3/2 tuplet of the 1/8 kind would get exceptions looked up
;;;     under 1/12.
;;;
;;; If no values are given for beatBase and measureBeats, default values
;;;   will be assigned:
;;;   beatBase gets the value (/ time-signature-denominator)
;;;   beatStructure gets a list of (3 3 3 ...), where the number of entries is the
;;;     number of beats, each containing 3 base-moments, if the time
;;;     signature numerator is greater than 3 and divisible by 3, and
;;;     a list of (1 1 1 ...), where the number of entries is the
;;;     number of base moments in a measure otherwise.
