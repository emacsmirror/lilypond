Alternative shapes for flags on eighth and shorter notes can be displayed by
overriding the @code{stencil} property of @code{Flag}.  LilyPond provides
the following functions: @code{modern-straight-flag},
@code{old-straight-flag}, and @code{flat-flag}.  Use @code{\\revert} to
restore the default shape.

To get stacked (i.e., vertically more compact) flags, call the command
@code{\\flagStyleStacked}, which can be reset with
@code{\\flagStyleDefault}.

Overriding the @code{Flag} stencil does not change how flag elements are
positioned vertically.  This is especially noticeable for flat flags:
LilyPond doesn't dynamically adjust the vertical gaps between flag elements
in the same way as it does for beams.  A possible solution to harmonize the
appearance is to replace flat flags with half beams, as shown in the second
staff; however, this can't be done automatically.  In the code of this
snippet, such half beams are entered with @code{@@} as a prefix, for example
@code{@@c8}.

Be aware that half beams are @emph{not} @code{Flag} grobs.  This means in
particular that modifying @code{Flag} properties won't have any effect on
them (you have to use @code{Beam} properties instead), and properties for
their associated @code{Stem} grob will also behave beam-like.
