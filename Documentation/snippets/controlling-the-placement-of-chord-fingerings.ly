The placement of fingering numbers can be controlled precisely by using
the property @code{fingeringOrientation}.  For fingering orientation to
apply, the fingering command must be used within a chord construct
(@code{<...>}), even for single notes.  Orientation for string numbers
and right-hand fingerings may be controlled in a similar way by using
the properties @code{stringNumberOrientation} and
@code{strokeFingerOrientation}, respectively.

These properties can be set to a list of one to three values.  They
control whether fingerings may be placed above (if @code{up} appears in
the list), below (if @code{down} appears), to the left (if @code{left}
appears), or to the right (if @code{right} appears).  Conversely, if a
location is not listed, no fingering is placed there.  LilyPond takes
these constraints and works out the best placement for the fingering of
the notes of the following chords.  Note that @code{left} and
@code{right} are mutually exclusive -- fingerings may be placed only on
one side or the other, not both.
