This section includes elements of music notation that arise when
writing specifically for wind instruments.


@node Common notation for wind instruments
@section Common notation for wind instruments

This section discusses notation common to most wind instruments.


@node References for wind instruments
@subsection References for wind instruments

@cindex wind instrument

Many notation issues for wind instruments pertain to breathing and
tonguing:

@itemize
@item Breathing can be specified by rests or @ref{Breath marks}.
@item Legato playing is indicated by @ref{Slurs}.
@item Different types of tonguings, ranging from legato to non-legato to
staccato are usually shown by articulation marks, sometimes combined
with slurs, see @ref{Articulations and ornamentations} and
@ref{List of articulations}.
@item Flutter tonguing is usually indicated by placing a tremolo mark
and a text markup on the note.  See @ref{Tremolo repeats}.
@end itemize

Other aspects of musical notation that can apply to wind instruments:

@itemize
@item Many wind instruments are transposing instruments, see
@ref{Instrument transpositions}.
@item Slide glissandi are characteristic of the trombone, but other
winds may perform keyed or valved glissandi.  See @ref{Glissando}.
@item Harmonic series glissandi, which are possible on all brass
instruments but common for French Horns, are usually written out as
@ref{Grace notes}.
@item Pitch inflections at the end of a note are discussed in
@ref{Falls and doits}.
@item Key slaps or valve slaps are often shown by the @code{cross} style
of @ref{Special note heads}.
@item Woodwinds can overblow low notes to sound harmonics.  These are
shown by the @code{flageolet} articulation.
See @ref{List of articulations}.
@item The use of brass mutes is usually indicated by a text markup, but
where there are many rapid changes it is better to use the
@code{stopped} and @code{open} articulations.
See @ref{Articulations and ornamentations} and
@ref{List of articulations}.
@item Stopped horns are indicated by the @code{stopped} articulation.
See @ref{Articulations and ornamentations}.

@node Fingerings
@subsection Fingerings

All wind instruments other than the trombone require the use of several
fingers to produce each pitch.  Some fingering examples are shown in
the snippets below.

Woodwind diagrams can be produced and are described in
@ref{Woodwind diagrams}.

@node Bagpipes
@section Bagpipes

This section discusses notation common bagpipes.


@node Bagpipe definitions
@subsection Bagpipe definitions

@cindex bagpipe
@cindex Scottish highland bagpipe
@cindex grace note
@funindex \taor
@funindex \hideKeySignature
@funindex \showKeySignature

LilyPond contains special definitions for Scottish, Highland Bagpipe
music; to use them, add

@example
\include "bagpipe.ly"
@end example

@noindent
to the top of your input file.  This lets you add the special grace notes
common to bagpipe music with short commands.  For example, you could
write @code{\taor} instead of

@example
\grace @{ \small G32[ d G e] @}
@end example

@file{bagpipe.ly} also contains pitch definitions for the bagpipe
notes in the appropriate octaves, so you do not need to worry about
@code{\relative} or @code{\transpose}.

@lilypond[ragged-right,verbatim,quote,notime]
\include "bagpipe.ly"
{ \grg G4 \grg a \grg b \grg c \grg d \grg e \grg f \grA g A }
@end lilypond

Bagpipe music nominally uses the key of D Major (even though that
isn't really true).  However, since that is the only key that can be used,
the key signature is normally not written out.  To set this up correctly,
always start your music with @code{\hideKeySignature}.  If you for some
reason want to show the key signature, you can use @code{\showKeySignature}
instead.

Some modern music use cross-fingering on c and@tie{}f to flatten those notes.
This can be indicated by @code{c-flat} or @code{f-flat}.  Similarly, the
@emph{Piobaireachd} high@tie{}g can be written @code{g-flat} when it occurs in light
music.

@node Woodwinds
@section Woodwinds

This section discusses notation specifically for woodwind instruments.


@node Woodwind diagrams
@subsection Woodwind diagrams

Woodwind diagrams can be used to indicate the fingering to be used
for specific notes and are available for the following instruments:

@itemize
@item piccolo
@item flute
@item oboe
@item clarinet
@item bass clarinet
@item saxophone
@item bassoon
@item contrabassoon
@end itemize

@noindent
Woodwind diagrams are created as markups:

@lilypond[verbatim,quote,fragment]
c''1^\markup {
  \woodwind-diagram #'piccolo #'((lh . (gis))
                                 (cc . (one three))
                                 (rh . (ees)))
}
@end lilypond

Keys can be open, partially-covered, ring-depressed, or fully
covered. The angle of partially-covered keys can be specified:

@lilypond[verbatim,quote]
\markup \override #'(baseline-skip . 22) \column {
  \override #'(baseline-skip . 2.5) \fill-line {

                                 (rh . ()))
    ""
  }
}
@end lilypond

Trills are indicated as shaded keys, or in non-graphical mode,
as either circled (the default) or shaded text:

@lilypond[verbatim,quote]

@end lilypond

The list of all possible keys and settings for a given instrument
can be displayed on the console using
@code{#(print-keys-verbose 'flute)} or in the log file using
@code{#(print-keys-verbose 'flute (current-error-port))}, although
they will not show up in the music output.

Creating new diagrams is possible, although this will require
Scheme ability and may not be accessible to all users.  The
patterns for the diagrams are in files
@file{scm/define-@/woodwind-@/diagrams.scm} and
@file{scm/display-@/woodwind-@/diagrams.scm}.
