@section Contemporary music

From the beginning of the 20th Century there has been a massive
expansion of compositional style and technique.  New harmonic
and rhythmic developments, an expansion of the pitch spectrum
and the development of a wide range of new instrumental
techniques have been accompanied by a parallel evolution and
expansion of musical notation.  The purpose of this section is
to provide references and information relevant to working with
these new notational techniques.

@cindex line, indicating duration
@cindex continuation, of notes

@funindex \-

Rhythmic items may be continued by a duration line, which gets represented by a
@code{DurationLine} grob.
Possible styles are @code{'beam}, @code{'line}, @code{'dashed-line},
@code{'dotted-line}, @code{'zigzag}, @code{'trill} and @code{'none}.
The duration line may end with a hook (beam-style only) or an arrow.
