@cindex orchestral strings

@cindex strings, writing for

This section provides information and references which are helpful
when writing for unfretted string instruments, principally
orchestral strings.


@node Common notation for unfretted strings
@section Common notation for unfretted strings

There is little specialist notation for unfretted string
instruments.  The music is notated on a single staff, and
usually only a single voice is required.  Two voices might
be required for some double-stopped or divisi passages.


@node References for unfretted strings
@subsection References for unfretted strings

Most of the notation which is useful for orchestral strings
and other bowed instruments is covered elsewhere:

@itemize

@item Textual indications such as @qq{pizz.} and @qq{arco} are
added as simple text -- see @ref{Text scripts}.

@item Fingerings, including the thumb indication, are described
in @ref{Fingering instructions}.

@item String numbers may be added (generally in roman
numbers for bowed instruments) as explained in
@ref{String number indications}.

@item Double stopping is normally indicated by writing a chord,
see @ref{Chorded notes}.  Directives for playing chords may be
added, see @ref{Arpeggio}.

@item Templates for string quartets can be found in
@rlearning{String quartet templates}.  Others are shown in the snippets.

@cindex bowing indication
@cindex @q{up-bow} bowing indication

@cindex open string indication
@cindex string, indicating open
@cindex string number

Bowing indications are created as articulations, which are
described in @ref{Articulations and ornamentations}.

The bowing commands, @code{\upbow} and @code{\downbow}, are used
with slurs as follows:

@lilypond[verbatim,quote]
\relative { c''4(\downbow d) e(\upbow f) }
@end lilypond

@noindent
Roman numerals can be used for string numbers (rather
than the default circled Arabic numbers), as explained in
@ref{String number indications}.

Alternatively, string indications may be printed using
markup commands; articulation scripts may also indicate
open strings.

@lilypond[verbatim,quote,fragment]
a'4 \open
\romanStringNumbers
a'\2
a'2^\markup { \small "sul A" }

@cindex diamond-shaped note head
@cindex natural harmonics
@cindex harmonics, natural
@funindex \harmonicsOn
@funindex \harmonicsOff

Natural harmonics can be notated in several ways.  A diamond-shaped
note head generally means to touch the string where you would stop
the note if it were not a diamond.

@lilypond[verbatim,quote]
\relative d'' {
  d4 e4.
  \harmonicsOn
  d8 e e
  d4 e4.
  \harmonicsOff
  d8 e e
}
@end lilypond

Alternatively a normal note head is shown at the pitch to be
sounded together with a small circle to indicate it should be
played as a harmonic:

@lilypond[verbatim,quote,fragment]
d''2^\flageolet d''_\flageolet
@end lilypond

@subsubheading Artificial harmonics

@cindex artificial harmonics
@cindex harmonics, artificial
@funindex \harmonic

Artificial harmonics are notated with two notes, one with a normal
note head indicating the stopped position and one with an open
diamond note head to indicate the harmonic position.

@c TODO If the default for harmonicDots is changed, change this
Artificial harmonics indicated with @code{\harmonic} do not show the
dots.  The context property @code{harmonicDots} should be set if
dots are required.

@lilypond[verbatim,quote]
\relative e' {
  <e a\harmonic>2.  <c g'\harmonic>4
  \set harmonicDots = ##t
  <e a\harmonic>2.  <c g'\harmonic>4

If you want to center a harmonic on a whole note, make it part of
a chord.

@cindex Bartók pizzicato
@cindex snap pizzicato

A @notation{snap pizzicato} (also known as @qq{Bartok pizz}) is a
type of pizzicato where the string is deliberately plucked upwards
(rather than sideways) such that it hits the fingerboard.

@lilypond[verbatim,quote]
\relative {
