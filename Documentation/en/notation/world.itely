@section World music

The purpose of this section is to highlight musical notation issues
that are relevant to traditions outside the Western tradition.


@node Common notation for non-Western music
@subsection Common notation for non-Western music

This section discusses how to enter and print music scores
that do not belong to the Western classical tradition,
also referred to as @notation{Common Practice Period}.


@node Extending notation and tuning systems
@unnumberedsubsubsec Extending notation and tuning systems

Standard classical notation (also known as
@notation{Common Practice Period} notation) is commonly
used in all sorts of music, not limited to @q{classical}
Western music.  This notation is discussed in
@ref{Writing pitches}, and the various note names
that may be used are explained in
@ref{Note names in other languages}.

Some types of non-Western music and folk/traditional music often employ
alternative or extended tuning systems that do not fit easily into
standard, classical notation.

Standard notation is still used but with pitch differences being
implicit.  For example, @notation{Arabic music} is notated with semi and
quarter tone accidentals but with precise pitch alterations being
determined by context.  In the case of @notation{Arabic music}, the init
file @file{arabic.ly} provides a suitable set of macros and definitions
that extend the standard notation using Italian note names.  For more
details see @ref{Arabic music}.

Other types of music require extended or unique notations, for example,
@notation{Turkish classical music} (also known as Ottoman classical
music) employs melodic forms known as @notation{makamlar} where
intervals are based on 1/9 divisions of the whole tone.  Standard,
Western staff notes are still used, but with special accidentals
uniquely defined in the files @file{turkish-makam.ly}.  For more
information on Turkish classical music and makamlar see

@cindex Arabic music
@cindex medium interval
@cindex maqam

Arabic music so far has been mainly an oral tradition.  When music
is transcribed, it is usually in a sketch format, on which
performers are expected to improvise significantly.  Increasingly,
Western notation, with a few variations, is adopted in order to
communicate and preserve Arabic music.

Some elements of Western musical notation such as the
transcription of chords or independent parts, are not required to
typeset the more traditional Arabic pieces.  There are however
some different issues, such as the need to indicate medium
intervals that are somewhere between a semi-tone and a tone, in
addition to the minor and major intervals that are used in Western
music.  There is also the need to group and indicate a large
number of different maqams (modes) that are part of Arabic music.

In general, Arabic music notation does not attempt to precisely
indicate microtonal elements that are present in musical practice.

Several issues that are relevant to Arabic music are covered
elsewhere:

@itemize
@item Note names and accidentals (including quarter tones) can be
tailored as discussed in @ref{Common notation for non-Western music}.

@item Additional key signatures can also be tailored as described
in @ref{Key signature}.

@item Complex time signatures may require that notes be grouped
manually as described in @ref{Manual beams}.

@item @notation{Takasim} which are rhythmically free
improvisations may be written down omitting bar lines as
described in @ref{Unmetered music}.

@cindex Hel-arabic note name

@cindex note name, Hel-arabic

Traditional Arabic note names (like @q{rast}, @q{dukah}, @q{sikah}, etc.@:)
can be quite long and so may not always be suitable for the purpose of
music writing.

Include the file @file{arabic.ly} to write Arabic sheet music.
The following example demonstrates how to write a @q{rast} scale:

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
\include "arabic.ly"
\relative {
  \key do \rast
  do' re misb fa | sol la sisb do | sib la sol fa | misb re do
}
@end lilypond

The file @file{arabic.ly} sets the note language to Italian (or Solfege),
since that is the modern standard in Arabic music and is widely adopted among
Arabic musicians.  If you prefer to write sheet music in another language,
simply change the language to your preferred language directly after including
the file @file{arabic.ly}.  This is a @q{rast} scale with English note names:

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
\include "arabic.ly"
\language "english"
\relative {
  \key c \rast
  c' d eqf f | g a bqf c | bf a g f | eqf d c
}
@end lilypond

@noindent
@qq{Rast} is a heptatonic scale that uses quarter tone intervals and is
considered the most important and central scale of the
@qq{Arabic Maqamat}.  For the full list of supported Arabic scales,
@pxref{Arabic key signatures}.

The use of standard Western notation to notate non-Western music is
discussed in @ref{Common notation for non-Western music}.  Also see
@ref{Note names in other languages}.


@cindex Arabic semi-flat symbol
@cindex semi-flat symbol, appearance

@funindex \dwn

The symbol for semi-flat does not match the symbol which is used
in Arabic notation.  The @code{\dwn} symbol defined in
@file{arabic.ly} may be used preceding a flat symbol as a work
around if it is important to use the specific Arabic semi-flat
symbol.  The appearance of the semi-flat symbol in the key
signature cannot be altered by using this method.

@node Arabic key signatures
@unnumberedsubsubsec Arabic key signatures

@cindex Arabic key signatures


In addition to the minor and major key signatures, LilyPond provides
the most common Arabic key signatures in the file @file{arabic.ly}.
With that being said LilyPond is not aiming at providing a full suite of all
possible maqams.  It rather defines the most common ones that are frequently
used and offers key signatures by grouping maqams together.
In general, a maqam uses the key signature of its family, or a
neighboring family, and varying accidentals are marked throughout the
music.  When forming key signatures neighboring maqam families are grouped
together.  For example, maqam @notation{saba} seldom occurs outside of the
context of maqam @notation{bayati} and adds only a single alteration.
Although both maqams come from different @emph{maqam families}
they are inside the same key signature @emph{group}.
Arabic maqams only allow for limited modulations, due to the
nature of Arabic musical instruments.

Here is an example of the key signature for a @qq{maqam muhayer} piece
of music:

@example
\key re \bayati
@end example

@noindent
Here @var{re} is the default pitch of the muhayer maqam, and
@notation{bayati} is the name of the base maqam in the group.

While the key signature indicates the group, it is common for the
title to indicate the more specific maqam, so in this example, the
name of @qq{maqam muhayer} should also appear in the title.

Other maqams in the same @notation{bayati} group, as shown in the table
below (e.g., @notation{bayati}, @notation{hussaini}, @notation{saba}, and
@notation{ushaq}) can be indicated in the same way.  These are all
variations of the base and most common maqam in the group, which is
@notation{bayati}.  They usually differ from the base maqam in their
upper tetrachords, or certain flow details that do not change their
fundamental nature, as siblings.

The other maqam in the same group (@notation{nawa}) is related to
@notation{bayati} by modulation and is shown in the table in
parentheses for those that are modulations of their base maqam.
@notation{Nawa}, for example, can be indicated as follows:

@example
\key sol \bayati
@end example

In Arabic music, the same term, for example @notation{bayati}, that is
used to indicate a maqam family, is also a maqam that is usually the
most important in the family so can also be thought of as a @emph{base
maqam}.

Here is the grouping that maps the more common maqams to
key signatures as defined in the file @file{arabic.ly}:

@cindex semai form
@cindex taqasim

Some Arabic and Turkish music classical forms such as
@notation{Semai} use unusual time signatures such as 10/8.  This
may lead to an automatic grouping of notes that is quite different
from existing typeset music, where notes may not be grouped on the
beat, but in a manner that is difficult to match by adjusting
automatic beaming.  The alternative is to switch off automatic
beaming and beam the notes manually.  Even if a match to existing
typeset music is not required, it may still be desirable to adjust
the automatic beaming behavior and/or use compound time signatures.

There are some variations in the details of how maqams are grouped,
despite agreement of grouping maqams related through common lower tetra
chords or by modulation.  There are also some inconsistencies, even
within the same texts, on how key signatures for a particular maqam
should be specified.  However, it is common to use a key signature per
@q{group} of maqams instead of individual key signatures for each maqam
separately.

Turkish classical music developed in the Ottoman Empire at roughly the
same time as classical music in Europe, and has continued on into the
20th and 21st centuries as a vibrant and distinct tradition with its own
compositional forms, theory and performance styles.  Among its striking
features is the use of microtonal intervals based on @q{commas} of 1/9
of a tone, from which are constructed the melodic forms known as
@notation{makam} (plural @notation{makamlar}) are constructed.

Some issues relevant to Turkish classical music are covered elsewhere.
Special note names and accidentals are explained in
@ref{Common notation for non-Western music}.


@node Turkish note names
@unnumberedsubsubsec Turkish note names

@cindex Turkish note name
@cindex makam
@cindex makamlar

Pitches in Turkish classical music traditionally have unique names and
the basis of pitch on 1/9-tone divisions means that makamlar employ a
completely different set of intervals compared to Western scales and
modes:

From a modern, notational point of view it is convenient to use
standard, Western staff notes (c, d, e, etc.@:) but with custom
accidentals that raise or lower notes by intervals of 1/9, 4/9, 5/9 or
8/9 of a tone.

These custom accidentals are defined in the file
@file{turkish-makam.ly}.

LilyPond supports over 200 makam key signature definitions -- well
beyond what is used in Turkish classical music -- with each makam having
its own specific tonic / finalis pitch (known as @q{karar} in Turkish).

It is important to be aware of the finalis of each makam.  Here is an
example where @var{g} is the default tonic and @var{rast} is the name of
the makam.

@example
\key g \rast

@cindex semi-flat symbol, Persian (koron)
@cindex semi-sharp symbol, Persian (sori)
@cindex Persian accidentals (sori, koron)

The notation for Persian classical music commonly uses two
accidentals for microtones, @dfn{sori} and @dfn{koron}.  Invented
by Ali-Naqi Vaziri around 1935, they indicate raising and lowering
a pitch by (approximately) a quarter tone, respectively.

@lilypond[quote]

  }

@end lilypond

The file @file{persian.ly}@footnote{There exists another, older
support file for Persian classical music also called
@file{persian.ly} (written by Kees van den Doel) that no longer
works with the current LilyPond version; while note names are
compatible, the selection of key signatures is not.} provides
support for koron and sori; they can be obtained by appending
@q{k} (koron) and @q{o} (sori) to the English note symbols.

LilyPond supports tunings for all major Persian modes in all keys,
sufficient to notate the @dfn{gusheh}s (central nuclear melodies)
of all @dfn{dastgah}s (musical modal systems).

The note immediately following a koron is sometimes@footnote{If
the interval defined by the note before the koron and after the
koron is a minor third.  The same is true for the note below the
finalis in the @q{Esfahan} dastgah according to some (but not all)
Persian musicians.} lowered by about 20@tie{}cents.  This is not
notated but considered part of the tuning.  However, for getting
better MIDI support you can make a sound flat by appending @q{v}
to the note name (@q{@emph{v}lat}).  This note should actually
also get a strong vibrato, and the vibrato and low tuning are
perceptually integrated (@emph{serialism}).  This is just for MIDI
and has no effect on the notation itself.

There are no further tuning issues in Persian music.  Since the
music is monophonic, the difference between just intonation (for
example) and equal temperament is merely academic -- there are no
chords where out-of-tune intervals would be noticeable.

In dastgah @q{Shur}, the 5th degree can either be natural or

Secondary dastgahs @q{Dashti}, @q{Abuata}, and @q{Bayat-e-tork}
use @code{\shur}, the derived dastgah @q{Afshari} uses
@code{\shurk}.  @q{Nava} on@tie{}G is like @q{Shur} on@tie{}D (a

tunings are @code{\esfahan} (@q{Homayoun} on@tie{}C is like
@q{Esfahan} on@tie{}G, a 5th apart), @code{\chahargah}, and
@code{\mokhalefsegah}.  For dastgahs @q{Mahur} and
@q{Rast-panjgah} the same tuning @code{\mahur} can be used.

All the various modulatory gushehs in all dastgahs can be notated
with these tunings, with the exception of @q{Delkash} in
@q{Mahur}, but traditionally the peculiar accidentals there are
notated explicitly (however, @file{persian.ly} also defines a
tuning @code{\delkashMahur}).

As an example, Chahargah in@tie{}D can be input with the
