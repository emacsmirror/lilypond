@cindex percussion

@funindex \drummode
@funindex \drums

Percussion notes may be entered in @code{\drummode} mode, which is
similar to the standard mode for entering notes.  The simplest way
to enter percussion notes is to use the @code{\drums} command,
which creates the correct context and entry mode for percussion:

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
\drums {
  hihat4 hh bassdrum bd
}
@end lilypond

This is shorthand for:

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
\new DrumStaff \drummode {
  hihat4 hh bassdrum bd
}
@end lilypond

Each piece of percussion has a full name and an abbreviated name,
and both can be used in input files.  The full list of percussion
note names may be found in @ref{Percussion notes}.

@cindex clef, percussion
@cindex percussion clef

Note that the normal notation of pitches (such as @code{cis4}) in a
@code{DrumStaff} context will cause an error message.  Percussion clefs
are added automatically to a @code{DrumStaff} context but they can also
be set explicitly.  Other clefs may be used as well.

@lilypond[quote,ragged-right,verbatim]
\drums {
  \clef percussion
  bd4 4 4 4
  \clef treble
  hh4 4 4 4
}

@node Drum rolls
@unnumberedsubsubsec Drum rolls

Drum rolls are indicated with three slashes across the stem.  For
quarter notes or longer the three slashes are shown explicitly,
eighth notes are shown with two slashes (the beam being the
third), and drum rolls shorter than eighths have one stem slash to
supplement the beams.  This is achieved with the tremolo notation,
as described in @ref{Tremolo repeats}.

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
\drums {

  8 8 4:32 ~

}
@end lilypond

Sticking can be indicated by placing a markup for @code{"R"}
or @code{"L"} above or below notes, as discussed in
@ref{Direction and placement}.  The @code{staff-padding} property
may be overridden to achieve a pleasing baseline.

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
\drums {
  \repeat unfold 2 {
    sn16^"L" 16^"R" 16^"L" 16^"L" 16^"R" 16^"L" 16^"R" 16^"R"

@cindex percussion
@cindex drum

A percussion part for more than one instrument typically uses a
multi-line staff where each position in the staff refers to one
piece of percussion.  To typeset the music, the notes must be
interpreted in @code{DrumStaff} and @code{DrumVoice} context.

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
up = \drummode {
  crashcymbal4 hihat8 halfopenhihat hh hh hh openhihat
}
down = \drummode {
  bassdrum4 snare8 bd r bd sn4
}
\new DrumStaff <<
  \new DrumVoice { \voiceOne \up }
  \new DrumVoice { \voiceTwo \down }
>>
@end lilypond

The above example shows verbose polyphonic notation.  The short
polyphonic notation, described in @rlearning{I'm hearing voices},
can also be used.
For example,

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
\new DrumStaff <<
  \drummode {
    bd4 sn4 bd4 sn4
    << {
      \repeat unfold 16 hh16
    } \\ {
      bd4 sn4 bd4 sn4
    } >>
  }
>>
@end lilypond

There are also other layout possibilities.  To use these, set the
property @code{drumStyleTable} in context @code{DrumVoice}.  The
following variables have been predefined:

@table @code
@item drums-style
This is the default.  It typesets a typical drum kit on a
five-line staff:

@lilypond[quote,line-width=12.0\cm]
nam = \lyricmode {
  cymc cyms cymr
  hh hhc hho hhho hhp hhs
  cb hc bd sn ss
  tomh tommh tomml toml tomfh tomfl }
mus = \drummode {
  cymc cyms cymr \break
  hh hhc hho hhho hhp hhs \break
  cb hc bd sn ss \break
  tomh tommh tomml toml tomfh tomfl }
\score {
  << \new DrumStaff \with {
       \remove Bar_engraver
       \remove Time_signature_engraver
       \hide Stem
       \override Stem.Y-extent = ##f
     } \mus
     \new Lyrics \nam
  >>
  \layout {
    \context {
      \Score
      \override LyricText.font-family = #'typewriter
      \override LyricText.font-features = #'("-liga")
      \override BarNumber.transparent = ##t
    }
  }
}
@end lilypond

The drum scheme supports six different toms.  When there are fewer
toms, simply select the toms that produce the desired result.  For
example, to get toms on the three middle lines you use
@code{tommh}, @code{tomml}, and @code{tomfh}.

@item agostini-drums-style
Invented by the French percussionist Dante Agostini in 1965, this notation is
commonly employed in France but also elsewhere.

@node Custom percussion staves
@unnumberedsubsubsec Custom percussion staves

@cindex percussion, custom
@funindex drumStyleTable

Custom percussion styles may be defined, to which the
@code{drumStyleTable} property may then be set.
Existing notations may be redefined as an association list
where each entry has to be comprised of four items:
a name, the note head style (or @samp{()} to indicate the default), an
articulation sign if needed (or @code{#f} if not), and
the note head's position on the staff.  That list must then
be converted into a Scheme hash table, using the
@code{alist->hash-table} function.

The entry for an articulation can either be a script name symbol
or a pair, with the first element the script name symbol and the
second a forced-direction indicator for the script.

[In the following example, note the use of the quasi-quotation
shorthand (@samp{`}) at the beginning of the Scheme expression
instead of the standard quotation shorthand (@samp{'}), which
enables the unquote shorthand (@samp{,}) to evaluate the element
it precedes.]

@funindex \open
@funindex \halfopen
@funindex \stopped
@cindex half-open high hat
@cindex high hat, half-open
@cindex pedal high hat
@cindex high hat, pedal
@cindex pedal splash high hat

@end lilypond

@funindex drumPitchNames

New names may also be added to these custom notations through
the @code{drumPitchNames} variable, that may be redefined as
an association list (or augmented by @code{append}ing a new list
to its existing value, as demonstrated below), but also through
its individual entries.  This also makes it possible to define
aliases: alternate input shorthand for some notations.

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
drumPitchNames =
  #(append
    '((leftsnap . sidestick)
      (rightsnap . ridecymbal))
    drumPitchNames)

drumPitchNames.ls = #'sidestick
drumPitchNames.rs = #'ridecymbal

\drums {
  leftsnap4. rightsnap8 leftsnap4 rightsnap
  ls8 rs ls rs ls4 rs
}
@end lilypond

@funindex midiDrumPitches
@funindex drumPitchTable

In a similar manner, the @code{drumPitchTable} property
associates a specific pitch (meaning a different instrument
sound, as provided by available MIDI sound fonts) to each
notation.  That property needs to be defined as a hash table,
which is again converted from an association list (stored by
default as the @code{midiDrumPitches} variable).  Redefining
these associations is achieved as explained above, either by
defining an entire association list or through individual entries.
The following example demonstrates how to create a whole
notation set with its own input syntax, custom notations and
corresponding MIDI output.

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
drumPitchNames.dbass     = #'dbass
drumPitchNames.dba       = #'dbass  % 'db is in use already
