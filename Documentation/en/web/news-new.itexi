@subheading LilyPond 2.25.20 released  @emph{September 29, 2024}

We are happy to announce the release of LilyPond 2.25.20. This is
termed a development release, but these are usually reliable for
testing new features and recent bug fixes. However, if you require
stability, we recommend using version 2.24.4, the current stable
release.

@subheading LilyPond 2.24.4 released!  @emph{July 21, 2024}

We are proud to announce the release of GNU LilyPond 2.24.4. LilyPond is a
music engraving program devoted to producing the highest-quality sheet music
possible. It brings the aesthetics of traditionally engraved music to computer
printouts.

This version contains a number of fixes since the release of the previous
stable version in November 2023. We recommend all users to update.
Scores converted to or written for 2.24.0 will continue to work with this
release. A list of added features and other user-visible changes for 2.24
can be found at @uref{https://lilypond.org/doc/v2.24/Documentation/changes/}.
Among others, version 2.24.0 switched to Guile 2.2 and features a completely
rewritten infrastructure for creating the official packages, finally allowing
us to offer 64-bit binaries for macOS and Windows.

For distributions, Guile 3.0 is officially supported since the previous
LilyPond 2.24.3, even though the recommended version will remain Guile 2.2
for the LilyPond 2.24 series.
