We are proud to announce the release of GNU LilyPond 2.24.3. LilyPond is a

For distributions, LilyPond 2.24.3 most notably includes a fix to restore PDF

other high-level problems.  In the time spans where his health
permitted it, he was able to significantly reduce the amount of
remaining problems for the Guile 2 migration after having started
working on them in 2010, making the goal that we finally reached
now more tangible for others to work on after he left us in 2015.

@subheading Two LilyPond projects in Google Summer of Code 2016  @emph{April 23, 2016}

We are happy to see two students, Nathan Chou and Jeffery Shivers, working on
LilyPond as participants in the Google Summer of Code this year.  We hope they
produce great results and stay in the developer community afterwards.

Nathan will tackle an annoying limitation, namely the unability of spanners
to cross voices.  His work will make a class of ugly workarounds obsolete.
Jeffery will bring the ScholarLY package[1] to production quality and add a
LaTeX package to it, making it possible to create beautiful critical reports
from data encoded directly in the LilyPond score.

@subheading LilyPond 2.18.0 released!  @emph{December 29, 2013}

We are proud to announce the release of GNU LilyPond 2.18.0.
LilyPond is a music engraving program devoted to producing the
highest-quality sheet music possible.  It brings the aesthetics of
traditionally engraved music to computer printouts.

Among the numerous improvements and changes, the following might
be most visible:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Many items are now positioned using their actual outline rather
than a@tie{}rectangular bounding box.  This greatly reduces
the occurrence of unsightly large gaps.

@item
Sets and overrides can now use the syntax
@example
\override Voice.TextSpanner.bound-details.left.text = "rit."
@end example
instead of the previous
@example
\override Voice.TextSpanner #'(bound-details left text) = "rit."
@end example

@item
Triplets with a given group length can now be written as
@example
\tuplet 3/2 4 @{ c8 c c  c c c @}
@end example
instead of
@example
\times 2/3 @{ c8 c c @}  \times 2/3 @{ c8 c c @}
@end example
@end itemize

A full list of noteworthy new features is given in:

@example
@uref{https://lilypond.org/doc/v2.18/Documentation/changes/index.html}

Great thanks go to the large number of LilyPond enthusiasts whose
financial backing enabled one core developer, David Kastrup, to
focus exclusively on LilyPond during the entire development cycle.

are also setup, so you can readily run LilyPond on the .ly output.
The important occasion for this release is our new build

for all platforms (including MacOS, Windows, Linux/x86, but probably
FreeBSD too) will be more quickly available for download.
A happy 2006 from the LilyPond Development Team!

LilyPond 2.5.3 was released. A new script, `\espressivo' has
been added, for a combination of crescendo and decrescendo
on a single note. In markups, expressions stacked with
`\column', `\center-align', etc, are not grouped with `< ...
>' anymore, but with `@{ ... @}'. LilyPond will now avoid line
breaks that cause long texts to stick outside of the page
staff. Grace notes following a main note, used to be entered
by letting the grace notes follow a skip in a parallel
expression.

LilyPond 2.5.1 is out. This is an experimental release,
containing some proof-of-concept code for our graphical
layout editor. You can add and remove things from the file,
and the tweaks will still work, as long as the tweaked notes
remain in the place (i.e., start at the same time-wise and be
part of the same context). Further attractions are: the
gnome backend now also draws beams and slurs, updates to the
SVG backend, support for the lmodern font set for TeX,
various bugfixes.

Positioning of slurs can now be adjusted manually, Grace
notes are correctly quoted and formatted when using cue
notes, Cue notes can now be created with
@verbatim

\cueDuring #VOICE-NAME #DIRECTION { MUSIC }

@end verbatim
Stemlets (short stems over beamed rests) have been added.
In addition, Jan hacked together some highly experimental

the -f gnome backend. These tweaks can be saved and are

LilyPond 2.3.16 was released. It fixes a couple of annoying

pass note heads much closer than the average distance get an extra
penalty. This fixes a lot of difficult slurring cases. See

Please consider this release as a 3.0 pre-release so try to find as
many bugs as possible. A report including a small .ly example
can be filed at bug-lilypond@@gnu.org
In this case, a bug is defined as something that the current 2.3 does
worse than the latest 2.2 release.  We want to be sure that no output

will hold users back in switching.
