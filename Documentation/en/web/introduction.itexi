@subheading Our Goal

@imageFloat{flat-design,png,right}

LilyPond came about when two musicians wanted to go beyond the
soulless look of computer-printed sheet music.  Musicians prefer
reading beautiful music, so why couldn't programmers write
software to produce elegant printed parts?

The result is a program that creates beautiful sheet music
following the best traditions of classical music engraving.
It takes care of the details of layout programmatically,
allowing composers, transcribers and publishers to focus
on the @emph{music} instead of improving their software's
default output.  Performers will get parts that let them
concentrate on @emph{playing} music instead of @emph{reading} it.

@node Features
@unnumberedsec Features
@divClass{column-center-top}


@subheading Excellent classical engraving

@imageFloat{flat-design,png,right}

LilyPond allows musicians to produce elegant sheet music that is
easy to read.  Its developer community has spent thousands of hours
developing powerful music engraving software that results in beautifully
engraved music.  All of LilyPond's style settings, font designs and
algorithms have been inspired by the finest hand-engraved music.
LilyPond output has the same strong, balanced and elegant look as the
best-engraved classical scores.  This is further explained in our
@ref{Essay}.


@divEnd

@divClass{column-center-top}
@subheading Text input

@subsubheading Everything is explicit

LilyPond processes text input, which contains all information
about the @emph{content} of your score and can easily be read
by any human or another program. There are no obscure
settings hidden behind menu items and binary file storage.

Read more about this concept on @ref{Text input}.


@subsubheading Tweaks are robust and traceable

If you have to change anything in the layout this tweak will
also be explicitly visible in the input file in human-readable
form, so you will always be able to retrace what you've done.
If you should accidentally break anything you can easily revert
or modify any decision without being at the mercy of an
@emph{Undo} function.


@subsubheading Text files are failure- and future-proof

Text files are very robust against file corruption. And as they are
human-readable, you will always be able to interpret them even if
you don't have access to the programs that created them.


@subsubheading Manage your scores with version control

Text files are applicable to be managed by version control. Go
for it and experience infinite and selective undo/redo mechanisms
and the full development history of your scores. Version control
may also open up new (collaborative) workflows for you.

@divEnd

@divClass{column-center-top}
@subheading Usability

@imageFloat{lilypond-book,png,right}


@subsubheading Effective layout choices

Spend less time with tweaking the output; LilyPond gets the
formatting correct right from the start.  It determines spacing by
itself, and breaks lines and pages to provide a tight and uniform
layout.  Clashes between lyrics, notes, and chords are resolved
and slurs and beams are sloped, automatically!


@subsubheading Mix music and text

Put fragments of music into texts without cutting and pasting
pictures.  Integrate music into @LaTeX{} or HTML seamlessly, or add
music to OpenOffice.org and LibreOffice with
@uref{https://extensions.services.openoffice.org/en/project/OOoLilyPond,OOoLilyPond}.
Plugins are also available to allow LilyPond code in various blogs and
wikis, making online collaboration possible.


@subsubheading Accessibility

Text-based input also makes score-writing possible for users with
severe physical disabilities.  Dexterity-impaired users who are
unable to type or control a computer mouse can use
speech-recognition software to edit LilyPond files.  Even users
who are totally blind can use screen-reading software to write
LilyPond files -- an impossible task in graphical-based
score-writing programs.
You can see a spectacular score on @ref{Examples}.

@subsubheading Editor diversity

Several developers, themselves active LilyPond users,
have written tools specifically aimed at making the process of editing
LilyPond files faster and more effective; you are not tied to
a single user interface but can use different tools for different tasks.
You can even use a full-fledged LilyPond editor at home and use your
mobile phone's notepad app to edit the files on the go. For some examples,
see @ref{Easier editing}.
@c TODO: Change this when the new pages have been written and pushed


@divEnd

@divClass{column-center-top}

@subheading Extensible design

@subsubheading Easy management of style sheets

All layout settings can be changed to suit your personal typographical
taste. So you can easily write style sheets that change every aspect of
LilyPond scores' default appearance. As these are also written as text
and can be stored in separate files you can simply switch between two
stylesheets to produce scores with a completely different appearance or
layout.
You want to print a score on A4 paper and project it with a beamer,
one system per page? LilyPond's layout engine will effortlessly produce
both from the same input.

@subsubheading Add your own functions

If that still is not enough, there is always the built-in
scripting language Scheme, which can access LilyPond's layout
engine at the same level as LilyPond itself does, making it
a @emph{very} powerful tool.
Settings, variables and functions are all documented in the
comprehensive program reference manual.

@subsubheading Process scores programmatically

LilyPond input files can fully be edited or even generated by programs
and scripts. This can for example be used for algorithmical composition.
But you can also access the musical content for analysis, or manage
input fragments in a database. There are no limitations except your
imagination.


@subsubheading Create new tools using LilyPond

As LilyPond isn't a monolithic GUI program but a command-line tool it
can be used from within other applications too. This way it is possible
to equip tools like, e.g., web applications with LilyPond's engraving
power. There already exist several online tools using LilyPond.


@divEnd

@divClass{column-center-top}

@subheading Environment

@imageFloat{frescobaldi-lilypond-editor-small,png,right}



@subsubheading Excellent support

LilyPond runs on all popular platforms: GNU/Linux, macOS, and
Windows.  LilyPond comes with extensive documentation and hundreds
of example files.  There is an active user community answering
questions on the lilypond-user mailing list, offering you friendly
help. The response time is usually very short, and often brillant
solutions to reported problems are developed. Thanks to the close
interaction with the development team such solutions are regularly
included in LilyPond itself.
Read more in @ref{Community}.


@subsubheading Free software

LilyPond can be downloaded free of charge!  Yep - It's free.  Get
it from the download page.

It's also free (as in @qq{speech}) software.  It comes with source
code, and permission to change and copy it.  So, are you irritated
by a bug, or yearning for a feature? Simply add it yourself, or
pay someone else to do it.

@node Examples
@unnumberedsec Examples

@divClass{column-center-top}
@subheading Beautiful Examples

LilyPond is a powerful and flexible tool for engraving tasks of
all kinds.  Please browse our gallery of examples and be inspired!

@divEnd


@divClass{column-center-middle-color2}
@subheading Classical Music

This organ work by J.S. Bach is a fairly typical engraving project
in LilyPond.

@exampleImage{bach-bwv610}
@divEnd


@divClass{column-center-middle-color2}
@subheading Complex Notation

This example from @emph{Goyescas} by Enrique Granados shows some
of the more advanced features of typesetting, including kneed
beams, cross-staff stems, and voice-follow lines.

@exampleImage{granados}
@divEnd


@divClass{column-center-middle-color2}
@subheading Early Music

LilyPond also supports various types of ancient notation, such
as this passage of Gregorian chant.

@exampleImage{ancient-headword}
@divEnd


@divClass{column-center-middle-color2}
@subheading Modern Music

Contemporary composers find LilyPond well-suited to displaying
unusual notation.  Here is an excerpt from Trevor Bača's
@emph{Čáry}, for unaccompanied bass flute.

@exampleImage{cary}
@divEnd


@divClass{column-center-middle-color2}
@subheading Efficient, flexible creation of performance materials

Various performance materials can be created from the same source
code.  This is an excerpt of @uref{https://editions-nicolas-sceaux.fr/,
Nicolas Sceaux's} engraving of Handel's @emph{Giulio Cesare}, in
full score, piano-vocal reduction, and a violin part.

@exampleImage{sesto-full}

@exampleImage{sesto-piano}

@exampleImage{sesto-violin}

@divEnd


@divClass{column-center-middle-color2}
@subheading Tablature

LilyPond supports tablature notation, which can be customized to
suit any instrument that reads from tablature.  The tablature
staff is generated automatically from notes entered for the 5-line
staff.

@exampleImage{tab-example}
@divEnd


@divClass{column-center-middle-color2}
@subheading Vocal Music

LilyPond is excellent for vocal music of all kinds, from sacred
hymns to opera.  Here is a medieval motet with slightly unusual
requirements.  The tenor voice is written in a different meter
than the others, but must line up as if it were in the same meter.
LilyPond handles this most elegantly.  Note also the incipits with
Vaticana style clefs, the slashed stems indicating plicated notes,
and the ligature braces above certain groups of notes.

@exampleImage{aucun-snippet}
@divEnd


@divClass{column-center-middle-color2}
@subheading Lead Sheets

It is simple to create lead sheets with melody, lyrics,
chord names, and fretboards.  In this example you see some of the
predefined fretboard diagrams, but these can be heavily customized
to suit nearly any situation.

@exampleImage{chart}
@divEnd


@divClass{column-center-middle-color2}
@subheading Educational Applications

LilyPond is perfectly suited for educational purposes as well.
Here is an example of a simple counterpoint exercise.

@exampleImage{theory}
@divEnd


@divClass{column-center-middle-color2}
@subheading Large Projects

LilyPond is excellent for large projects like operas or works for
full symphony orchestra, as well.  In addition, the text-based
input provides greater accessibility -- this example was
contributed by Hu Haipeng, a blind composer.

@exampleImage{orchestra}

@divClass{keep-bullets}
@subheading What are the benefits to users?

@itemize

@item
No cost: download and try it out!  What do you have to lose?

@item
Sharing: if you like the program, give a copy to your friends,
teachers, students, and colleagues!

@item
Source available: if you are curious about how LilyPond creates
some notation, you can see exactly how it is done.

@item
Extendible: you can add features, fix bugs, and change the
functionality.  If you are not a programmer, you can hire somebody
to do those tasks.

This may not seem appealing to casual musicians, but the ability
to extend software can be highly valuable to serious composers,
companies, and academics.

@item
Future safety: if a commercial company goes bankrupt, what happens
to any electronic music which depends on their products?  This is
not a concern with LilyPond; even if the entire development team
quits (extremely unlikely), the program will still be legally
available for copying, modifications, and distribution.

@subheading Why do LilyPond developers @qq{give away} their work for free?

Most of us view LilyPond development as a hobby or volunteer work.
So this question is really asking @qq{why do people volunteer}?

@itemize

@item
Fun: working towards a goal can be enjoyable, especially when you
work as a team!

@item
Shared goals: we all want beautiful sheet music, but few people
have the expertise (and nobody has the time!), to create a program
which can handle all situations.  By working together -- one
person improves the automatic beaming code, another person
improves the shape of slurs, and a third person writes
documentation explaining how to use these features -- we can
achieve our goal with only a fraction of the individual effort.

@item
@qq{Gift culture}: the Free Software
movement has created many great software projects, such as
@uref{https://www.gnu.org/distros/, GNU/Linux},
@uref{https://www.getfirefox.com/, Mozilla Firefox}, and
@uref{https://www.wesnoth.org/, Battle for Wesnoth}.  Having
benefitted from these projects, some developers want to @qq{give
back} to the community.

@item
Work experience: contributing to free software projects is a great way to
practice programming, documentation writing, documentation translation,
or design.  This experience has helped some developers gain job offers
or scholarships.

some of the credit for this -- I spend a lot of time tweaking

me an excellent starting point, a very intuitive interface, and
the ability to modify absolutely anything if I want to take the

@subheading @qq{Compiling} Music

@imageClickable{nereid-shot-small,png, (click to enlarge), nereid-shot,png, right}

LilyPond is a @emph{compiled} system: it is run on a text file
describing the music.  The resulting output is viewed on-screen or
printed.  In some ways, LilyPond is more similar to a programming
language than graphical score editing software.

You do not write music by dragging notes from a graphical toolbar
and placing them on a dynamically refreshing score; you write
music by typing text.  This text is interpreted (or @qq{compiled})
by LilyPond, which produces beautifully engraved sheet music.

People accustomed to graphical user interfaces might need to learn
a new way of working, but the results are definitely worth it!

@warning{We present a quick overview of our text input -- it's not
as complicated as it sounds!  Don't worry about understanding
every detail in these examples; our beginner documentation covers
everything at a much more gradual pace.}


@subsubheading It's as simple as A B C

Notes are encoded with letters and numbers.  Special commands are
entered with backslashes.

@imageFloat{text-input-1-annotate,png,center}
@imageFloat{text-input-1-output,png,center}

Alterations are made with different names: add @w{@code{-is}} for
sharp, and @w{@code{-es}} for flat (these are Dutch note names, other
languages are available).  LilyPond figures out where to put
accidentals.

@subsubheading Pop music

Put chords and lyrics together to get a lead sheet:

@imageFloat{text-input-pop-annotate,png,center}
@imageFloat{text-input-pop-output,png,center}



@subsubheading Orchestral parts

The input file contains the notes of piece of music.  Score and
parts can be made from a single input file, so that changing a
note always affects the score and parts.  To be able to include
the same music in multiple places, the music is assigned to a
@qq{variable} (a name).

@imageFloat{text-input-parts-both-annotate,png,center}


This variable is then used in a single part (here transposed, with
condensed rests spanning several measures):

@imageFloat{text-input-parts-single-annotate,png,center}
@imageFloat{text-input-parts-single-output,png,center}


The same variable is used in the full score (here in concert
pitch):

@imageFloat{text-input-score-annotate,png,center}
@imageFloat{text-input-score-output,png,center}


@subsubheading Beginner Documentation

We realize that many users find this way of entering music a bit
odd.  For this reason, we have written extensive documentation to
help new users, beginning with @ref{Learning}.  The Learning
Manual is the best place to start, as many questions are answered
before they come up!

Occasionally new users are unnecessarily confused by some aspects
of LilyPond's behavior.  Please read this manual before doubting
whether LilyPond is working correctly.

More in-depth information is available in @ref{Manuals}.

Ben Lemon, a LilyPond user, has created a range of
@uref{https://benl.xyz/lilypond/operation-lilypond,video tutorials}
on his blog and which are aimed at new users.


@subsubheading Easier editing environments

@imageClickable{lilykde-screenshot-small,png,
  (click to enlarge),lilykde-screenshot,png,right}

LilyPond is primarily concerned with producing top-quality
engraved sheet music; creating a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
would distract us from this goal.  However, there are other
projects aimed at making it easier to create LilyPond input files.

Some editing environments include syntax highlighting, automatic
command completion, and pre-made templates.  Other programs
actually provide a GUI which allows direct manipulation of a
graphical score.  For more information, see @ref{Easier editing}.
