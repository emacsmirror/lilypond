This gentle, step-by-step installation tutorial guides you through
installing LilyPond and creating a first music score.

LilyPond input files are simple text files.  You can use any
editor for plain text to edit a LilyPond file (do @emph{not} use
editors for rich text such as Microsoft Word), but there are
several editors tailored specifically for LilyPond, making the
editing process very comfortable.  Because a choice has to be
made, this tutorial uses
@uref{https://frescobaldi.org,Frescobaldi}, which is the most
popular among such editors right now.  However, there are several
other options available.  For more information, see @rweb{Easier
editing}.

Please choose the tutorial according to your needs.  (If you don't
know what the @qq{command line} is, you want the graphical setup!)

These instructions work for the GNOME environment, for example on
the default flavors of Ubuntu and Fedora.  In other desktop
environments, they can likely be adapted.  For more minimal
GNU/Linux distributions, @pxref{Command line setup}.

First, find the GNOME Software app.

@center @sourceimage{linux-1-search-gnome-software,6cm,}

In GNOME Software, search @qq{Frescobaldi}.

@center @sourceimage{linux-2-search-frescobaldi,10cm,}

Install Frescobaldi.  Behind the scenes, this should also
automatically install some version of LilyPond.

@center @sourceimage{linux-3-install-frescobaldi,10cm,}

Open Frescobaldi.  It starts on a new file with some pre-filled
text that will be explained later.

@center @sourceimage{linux-4-frescobaldi-start,10cm,}

After the @code{\version} line, enter a new line containing exactly
this:

@example
@{ c' @}
@end example

Now click on the LilyPond icon or use the @kbd{Control-M} keyboard
shortcut.  On the right, a simple score appears.

@center @sourceimage{linux-5-frescobaldi-simple-file,10cm,}

Congratulations, you have just created your first music sheet with
LilyPond!  If you're satisfied now, you can skip the rest of this
section.  However, it may be that the version of LilyPond that was
installed is not the same one as this documentation is for.  If
you want a different LilyPond version, you can register it in
Frescobaldi, without losing the initial one.  To do this, download
the archive from @rweb{Download} and double-click to unpack it.
(The image shows the archive for version 2.23.10; for this
documentation, however, you should download the archive for
version @version{}.)

@center @sourceimage{linux-6-download-and-unpack-archive,14cm,}

Move the unpacked folder out of your @qq{Downloads} folder to the
folder where you want to permanently store it.  For example, put
it in your home folder.

Now, in Frescobaldi, go to the @qq{Preferences} menu.

@center @sourceimage{linux-7-frescobaldi-find-preferences,10cm,}

Select @qq{LilyPond Preferences}, and click @qq{Add} to register a
new LilyPond version.

@center @sourceimage{linux-8-frescobaldi-add-lilypond-version,10cm,}

Click on the file explorer icon.

@center @sourceimage{linux-9-frescobaldi-select-lilypond-executable,5cm,}

Navigate to the folder you have just extracted, then inside this
folder, double-click @samp{bin} and finally select
@samp{lilypond}.

@center @sourceimage{linux-10-navigate-to-lilypond-executable,13cm,}

You're done!  You can click @samp{OK}.  You now have two versions
of LilyPond installed.

@center @sourceimage{linux-11-frescobaldi-new-version-added,13cm,}

Now turn to @ref{Tutorial} to learn more about LilyPond's syntax.


@node Graphical setup under Windows
@section Graphical setup under Windows

Download LilyPond for Windows from @rweb{Download}.  This is a ZIP
archive called
@file{lilypond-@/@var{x}@.@var{y}.@var{z}-@/mingw-@/x86_64.zip} (where
@qq{mingw} means it's for Windows), for example
@file{lilypond-@/@version{}-@/mingw-@/x86_64.zip}.  Extract this in the
file explorer.  Place the resulting directory
@file{lilypond-@/@var{x}.@var{y}.@var{z}-@/mingw-@/x86_64} in a
permanent location; the actual folder doesn't matter, you just
need to put it somewhere you won't move it afterwards.  For
example, you could choose your home folder.

After this, download the latest release of Frescobaldi from
@uref{https://github.com/frescobaldi/frescobaldi/releases, the
project's download page} (this image and the next one refer to
version 3.2, which is not necessarily the newest one).  Choose the
@file{.exe} file.

@center @sourceimage{windows-1-frescobaldi-download-github,10cm,}

Double-click on the downloaded file in the file explorer.  This
launches the setup wizard.

@center @sourceimage{windows-2-frescobaldi-installer,6cm,}

Accept the license and install Frescobaldi using the wizard.  You
will find a startup screen like this:

@center @sourceimage{windows-3-frescobaldi-startup,10cm,}

Navigate to the Frescobaldi preferences.

@center @sourceimage{windows-4-frescobaldi-find-preferences,10cm,}

Navigate to @qq{LilyPond Preferences} on the left.

@center @sourceimage{windows-5-frescobaldi-find-lilypond-preferences,13cm,}

Click @qq{Edit} on the right.  This leads to a dialog for choosing
the LilyPond executable.

@center @sourceimage{windows-6-frescobaldi-select-lilypond-executable,5cm,}

Click on the folder icon and navigate to the
@file{lilypond-@/@var{x}.@var{y}.@var{z}-@/mingw-@/x86_64} folder
you previously created.  Inside this folder, open
@file{lilypond-@/@var{x}.@var{y}.@var{z}}, then @file{bin}, and
finally select @file{lilypond}.

@center @sourceimage{windows-7-frescobaldi-find-executable-from-explorer,12cm,}

Now click @qq{OK}.

@center @sourceimage{windows-8-frescobaldi-ok,5cm,}

Click @qq{OK} again.

@center @sourceimage{windows-9-frescobaldi-ok-2,10cm,}

Type this simple file in the window:

@example
\version "@version{}"

@{ c' @}
@end example

Compile it with the @kbd{Control-M} keyboard shortcut or by
clicking the @qq{LilyPond} icon.  A minimal score appears.

@center @sourceimage{windows-10-frescobaldi-done,10cm,}

Congratulations, you have just created your first music sheet with
LilyPond!  Now continue with the @ref{Tutorial} to learn more
about LilyPond's syntax.


@node Graphical setup under macOS
@section Graphical setup under macOS

Download LilyPond for macOS from @rweb{Download}.  This is an
archive called
@file{lilypond-@/@var{x}.@var{y}.@var{z}-@/darwin-@/x86_64@/.tar.gz}
(where @qq{darwin} means it's for macOS), for example
@file{lilypond-@/@version{}-@/darwin-@/x86_64@/.tar.gz}.  In the
Finder, extract this archive.  Place the resulting directory
@file{lilypond-@/@var{x}.@var{y}.@var{z}-@/darwin-@/x86_64} into a
permanent location; the actual folder doesn't matter, you just
need to put it somewhere you won't move it afterwards.  For
example, you could choose your home folder.

After this, download the latest release of Frescobaldi from
@uref{https://github.com/frescobaldi/frescobaldi/releases, the
project's download page} (the image refers to version 3.1.3, which
is not necessarily the newest one).  Choose the @file{.dmg} file.

@center @sourceimage{macos-1-frescobaldi-download-github,10cm,}

In the Finder, double-click on the file to run the installer.  At
this point, you might encounter a problem:

@center @sourceimage{macos-2-frescobaldi-cant-be-opened,5cm,}

This is because Frescobaldi is developed independently from Apple.
Nevertheless, it is totally secure software, but you have to tell
Apple so.  To do this, you first need to click @qq{Cancel}.
@emph{After having clicked @qq{Cancel}}, open the @qq{System
Preferences} app and select @qq{Security & Privacy}.

@center @sourceimage{macos-3-open-system-preferences-security,10cm,}

Then click @qq{Open Anyway}.

@center @sourceimage{macos-4-allow-open-anyway,8cm,}

This leads to a new security warning.  This time, you have the
option to accept.  Select @qq{Open}.  Again, do not fear:
Frescobaldi is completely secure for your system.

@center @sourceimage{macos-5-accept-security-warning,5cm,}

Frescobaldi is now open.  Find the Preferences.

@center @sourceimage{macos-6-frescobaldi-find-preferences,10cm,}

Click on @qq{LilyPond Preferences} on the left.

@center @sourceimage{macos-7-frescobaldi-find-lilypond-preferences,15cm,}

Click @qq{Edit} on the right.  This opens a new window:

@center @sourceimage{macos-8-frescobaldi-edit-lilypond-executable,5cm,}

Click on the @qq{folder} icon.  A Finder window opens.  Navigate
to the @file{lilypond-@/@var{x}.@var{y}.@var{z}-@/darwin-@/x86_64}
folder you saved earlier.  Inside it, find
@file{lilypond-@/@var{x}.@var{y}.@var{z}}, then @file{bin}, and
finally @file{lilypond}.

@center @sourceimage{macos-9-frescobaldi-navigate-to-lilypond-executable,12cm,}

When you press @qq{OK}, a new security warning about LilyPond will
likely appear.  Again, first click @qq{Cancel}, then enable
LilyPond in the preferences, and redo the procedure to select
@file{lilypond} in the Finder.

Now click @qq{OK} to everything until you are back to the main
Frescobaldi window.  Enter this simple file in source view on the
left:

@example
\version "@version{}"

@{ c' @}
@end example

Click on the button with the LilyPond icon to compile the file, or
use the @kbd{Control-M} keyboard shortcut.  For a third time, the
system will warn you about security, this time with @qq{gs}
(GhostScript).  Once more, go to the System Preferences and enable
the program to be executed.

Finally, the next compilation run will work and you will find a
minimal score.

@center @sourceimage{macos-10-minimal-score,11cm,}

Congratulations, you have just created your first music sheet with
LilyPond!  Now continue with the @ref{Tutorial} to learn more
about LilyPond's syntax.


@node Command line setup
@section Command line setup

On many GNU/Linux distributions, LilyPond can be installed from
the package manager.  This is also the case on macOS using either
@uref{https://www.macports.org,MacPorts} or
@uref{https://brew.sh,Homebrew}.

In any case, you can install LilyPond by downloading the archive
from @rweb{Download} and unpacking it.  The binaries are usable
immediately after unpacking.  You can run

@example
/@var{...}/lilypond-@var{x}.@var{y}.@var{z}/bin/lilypond file.ly
@end example

@noindent
(on Windows, replace the slashes @samp{/} with backslashes @samp{\}).

This compiles @code{file.ly}, and produces @code{file.pdf}.
To test your setup, you can use this minimal file:

@example
\version "@version{}"

@{ c' @}
@end example

This will produce this output in @file{file.pdf}:

@lilypond[quote]
{ c' }
@end lilypond

Now continue with the @ref{Tutorial} to learn more about
LilyPond's syntax, or see @rprogram{Command-line usage} for more
information on calling LilyPond on the command line.
