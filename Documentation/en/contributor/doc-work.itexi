@chapter Documentation work

There are currently 11 manuals for LilyPond, not including the
translations.  Each book is available in HTML, PDF, and info.  The
documentation is written in a language called @code{texinfo} --
this allows us to generate different output formats from a single
set of source files.

To organize multiple authors working on the documentation, we use a
Version Control System (VCS) called Git, previously discussed in
@ref{Working with source code}.

@node Introduction to documentation work
@section Introduction to documentation work

Our documentation tries to adhere to our @ref{Documentation
policy}.  This policy contains a few items which may seem odd.
One policy in particular is often questioned by potential
contributors: we do not repeat material in the Notation Reference,
and instead provide links to the @qq{definitive} presentation of
that information.  Some people point out, with good reason, that
this makes the documentation harder to read.  If we repeated
certain information in relevant places, readers would be less
likely to miss that information.

That reasoning is sound, but we have two counter-arguments.
First, the Notation Reference -- one of @emph{five} manuals for
users to read -- is already over 500 pages long.  If we repeated
material, we could easily exceed 1000 pages!  Second, and much
more importantly, LilyPond is an evolving project.  New features
are added, bugs are fixed, and bugs are discovered and documented.
If features are discussed in multiple places, the documentation
team must find every instance.  Since the manual is so large, it
is impossible for one person to have the location of every piece
of information memorized, so any attempt to update the
documentation will invariably omit a few places.  This second
concern is not at all theoretical; the documentation used to be
plagued with inconsistent information.

If the documentation were targeted for a specific version -- say,
LilyPond 2.10.5 -- and we had unlimited resources to spend on
documentation, then we could avoid this second problem.  But since
LilyPond evolves (and that is a very good thing!), and since we
have quite limited resources, this policy remains in place.

A few other policies (such as not permitting the use of tweaks in
the main portion of NR 1+2) may also seem counter-intuitive, but
they also stem from attempting to find the most effective use of
limited documentation help.

Before undertaking any large documentation work, contributors are
encouraged to contact the @code{lilypond-devel} mailing list.

@node version in documentation files
@section @code{\version} in documentation files

Every documentation file which includes LilyPond code must begin
with a @code{\version} statement, since the build procedure
explicitly tests for its presence and will not continue otherwise.
The @code{\version} statement should reference a version of LilyPond
consistent with the syntax of the contained code.

Since the @code{\version} statement is not valid Texinfo input it
must be commented out like this:

@example
@@c \version "2.19.1"
@end example

So, if you are adding LilyPond code which is not consistent with the
current version header, you should

@enumerate

@item
run convert-ly on the file using the latest version of LilyPond
(which should, if everybody has done proper maintenance, not change
anything);

@item
add the new code;

@item
modify the version number to match the new code.

@end enumerate


@node Documentation suggestions
@section Documentation suggestions

@subheading Small additions

For additions to the documentation,

@enumerate

@item
Tell us where the addition should be placed.  Please include both
the section number and title (i.e. "LM 2.13 Printing lyrics").

@item
Please write exact changes to the text.

@item
A formal patch to the source code is @emph{not} required; we can
take care of the technical details.

@item
Send the suggestions to the @code{bug-lilypond} mailing list as
discussed in @rweb{Contact}.

@item
Here is an example of a perfect documentation report:

@verbatim
To: bug-lilypond@gnu.org
From: helpful-user@example.net
Subject: doc addition

In LM 2.13 (printing lyrics), above the last line ("More options,
like..."), please add:

----
To add lyrics to a divided part, use blah blah blah.  For example,

\score {
  \notes {blah <<blah>> }
  \lyrics {blah <<blah>> }
  blah blah blah
}
----

In addition, the second sentence of the first paragraph is
confusing.  Please delete that sentence (it begins "Users
often...") and replace it with this:
----
To align lyrics with something, do this thing.
----

Have a nice day,
Helpful User
@end verbatim

@end enumerate


@subheading Larger contributions

To replace large sections of the documentation, the guidelines are
stricter.  We cannot remove parts of the current documentation
unless we are certain that the new version is an improvement.

@enumerate

@item
Ask on the lilypond-devel mailing list if such a rewrite is necessary;
somebody else might already be working on this issue!

@item
Split your work into small sections; this makes it much easier to
compare the new and old documentation.

@item
Please prepare a formal git patch.

@end enumerate

@subheading Contributions that contain examples using overrides

Examples that use overrides, tweaks, customer Scheme functions, etc.@: are
(with very few exceptions) not included in the main text of the manuals;
as there would be far too many, equally useful, candidates.

The correct way is to submit your example, with appropriate explanatory
text and tags, to the LilyPond Snippet Repository (LSR).  Snippets that
have the @qq{docs} tag can then be easily added as a
@emph{selected snippet} in the documentation.  It will also appear
automatically in the Snippets lists.  See @ref{Introduction to LSR}.

Snippets that @emph{don't} have the @qq{docs} tag will still be
searchable and viewable within the LSR, but will be not be included in
the Snippets list or be able to be included as part of the main
documentation.

Generally, any new snippets that have the @qq{docs} tag are more
carefully checked for syntax and formatting.

@subheading Announcing your snippet

Once you have followed these guidelines, please send a message to
lilypond-devel with your documentation submissions.  Unfortunately
there is a strict @q{no top-posting} check on the mailing list; to avoid
this, add:

@code{> I'm not top posting}

(you must include the > ) to the top of your documentation addition.

We may edit your suggestion for spelling, grammar, or style, and we may
not place the material exactly where you suggested, but if you give us
some material to work with, we can improve the manual much faster.

Thanks for your interest!

@node Texinfo introduction
@subsection Texinfo introduction

The language is called Texinfo; you can see its manual here:

@uref{https://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/manual/texinfo/}

However, you don't need to read those docs.  The most important
thing to notice is that text is text.  If you see a mistake in the
text, you can fix it.  If you want to change the order of
something, you can cut-and-paste that stuff into a new location.

@warning{Rule of thumb: follow the examples in the existing docs.
You can learn most of what you need to know from this; if you want
to do anything fancy, discuss it on @code{lilypond-devel} first.}


@node Documentation files
@subsection Documentation files

All manuals live in @file{Documentation/}.

In particular, there are four user manuals, their respective master
source files are @file{learning.tely} (LM, Learning Manual),
@file{notation.tely} (NR, Notation Reference),
@file{music-glossary.tely} (MG, Music Glossary), and
@file{lilypond-program} (AU).  Each chapter is written in a separate
file, ending in @file{.itely} for files containing lilypond code, and
@file{.itexi} for files without lilypond code, located in a subdirectory
associated to the manual (@file{learning/} for @file{learning.tely}, and
so on); list the subdirectory of each manual to determine the file name
of the specific chapter you wish to modify.

Developer manuals live in @file{Documentation/} too.  Currently there is
only one: the Contributor's Guide @file{contrib-guide.texi} you are
reading.

Snippet files are part of documentation, and the Snippet List (SL) lives
in @file{Documentation/} just like the manuals.  For information about
how to modify the snippet files and SL, see @ref{LSR work}.


@node Sectioning commands
@subsection Sectioning commands

The Notation Reference uses section headings at four, occasionally
five, levels.

@itemize

@item Level 1: @@chapter
@item Level 2: @@section
@item Level 3: @@subsection
@item Level 4: @@unnumberedsubsubsec
@item Level 5: @@subsubsubheading
@end itemize

The first three levels are numbered in HTML, the last two are not.
Numbered sections correspond to a single HTML page in the split HTML
documents.

The first four levels always have accompanying nodes so they can be
referenced and are also included in the ToC in HTML.

Most of the manual is written at level 4 under headings created with

@example
@@node Foo
@@unnumberedsubsubsec Foo
@end example

Level 3 subsections are created with

@example
@@node Foo
@@subsection Foo
@end example

Level 4 headings and menus must be preceded by level 3 headings and
menus, and so on for level 3 and level 2.  If this is not what is
wanted, please use:

@example
@@subsubsubheading Foo
@end example

Please leave two blank lines above a @code{@@node}; this makes it
easier to find sections in texinfo.

Do not use any @code{@@} commands for a @code{@@node}.  They may be
used for any @code{@@sub...} sections or headings however.

@example
not:
@@node @@code@{Foo@} Bar
@@subsection @@code@{Foo@} Bar

but instead:
@@node Foo Bar
@@subsection @@code@{Foo@} Bar
@end example

No punctuation may be used in the node names.  If the heading text
uses punctuation (in particular, colons and commas) simply leave
this out of the node name and menu.

@example
@@menu
* Foo Bar::
@@end menu

@@node Foo Bar
@@subsection Foo: Bar
@end example

Backslashes must not be used in node names.

@example
@@menu
* Set and unset
@@end menu

@@node Set and unset
@@subsection @@code@{\set@} and @@code@{\unset@}
@end example

With the exception of @code{@@} commands, @code{\} commands and
punctuation, the section name should match the node name exactly.

Sectioning commands (@code{@@node} and @code{@@section}) must not appear
inside an @code{@@ignore}.  Separate those commands with a space, ie
@code{@@n}@tie{}@code{ode}.

Nodes must be included inside a

@example
@@menu
* foo::
* bar::
@@end menu
@end example

@noindent
construct.  These can be constructed automatically:
@pxref{Regenerating menus}.


@node LilyPond formatting
@subsection LilyPond formatting

@itemize

@item
Most LilyPond examples throughout the documentation can be produced
with:

@example
@@lilypond[verbatim,quote]
@end example

If using @code{\book@{@}} in your example then you must also
include the @code{papersize=X} variable, where @code{X} is a defined
paper size from within @file{scm/paper.scm}.  This is to avoid the
default @code{a4} paper size being used and leaving too much unnecessary
whitespace and potentially awkward page breaks in the PDFs.

The preferred @code{papersize}s are @code{a5}, @code{a6} or
@code{a8landscape}.

@code{a8landscape} works best for a single measure with a single title
and/or single @code{tagline}:

@example
@@lilypond[papersize=a8landscape,verbatim]
\book @{
  \header @{
    title = "A scale in LilyPond"
  @}
  \relative @{
    c d e f
  @}
@}
@@end lilypond
@end example

and can also be used to easily show features that require page breaks
(i.e., page numbers) without taking large amounts of space within the
documentation.  Do not use the @code{quote} option with this paper size.

@code{a5} or @code{a6} paper sizes are best used for examples that have
more than two measures of music or require multiple staves (i.e., to
illustrate cross-staff features, RH and LH parts etc.@:) and where
@code{\book@{@}} constructions are required or where @code{a8landscape}
produces an example that is too cramped.  Depending on the example the
@code{quote} option may need to be omitted.

In rare cases, other options may be used (or omitted), but ask first.

@item
Please avoid using extra spacing either after or within the
@code{@@lilypond} parameters.

@example
not:          @@lilypond [verbatim, quote, fragment]
but instead:  @@lilypond[verbatim,quote,fragment]
@end example

@item
Inspirational headwords are produced with:

@example
@@lilypondfile[quote,ragged-right,line-width=16\cm,staffsize=16]
@{pitches-headword.ly@}
@end example

@item
LSR snippets are linked with:

@example
@@lilypondfile[verbatim,quote,ragged-right,texidoc,doctitle]
@{filename.ly@}
@end example

@item
Use two spaces for indentation in lilypond examples (no tabs).

@item
Try to avoid using @code{#'} or @code{#`} when describing
context or layout properties outside of an @code{@@example} or @code{@@lilypond}, unless
the description explicitly requires it.

i.e. @qq{...setting the @code{transparent} property leaves the object where it
is, but makes it invisible.}

@item
If possible, only write one bar per line.

@item
If you only have one bar per line, omit bar checks.  If you
must put more than one bar per line (not recommended), then include bar
checks.

@item
Tweaks should, if possible, also occur on their own line.
@example
not:          \override TextScript.padding = #3 c1^"hi"
but instead:  \override TextScript.padding = #3
              c1^"hi"
@end example

@noindent
excepted in Templates, where @q{doctitle} may be omitted.

@item
Avoid long stretches of input code.  Nobody is going to read
them in print.  Create small examples.  However, this does not mean
it has be minimal.

@item
Specify durations for at least the first note of every bar.

@item
If possible, end with a complete bar.

@item
Comments should go on their own line, and be placed before
the line(s) to which they refer.

@item
For clarity, always use @{ @} marks even if they are not technically
required; i.e.

@example
not:

\context Voice \repeat unfold 2 \relative c' @{
  c2 d
@}

but instead:

\context Voice @{
  \repeat unfold 2 @{
    \relative c' @{
      c2 d
    @}
  @}
@}
@end example

@item
Add a space around @{ @} marks; i.e.

@example
not:          \chordmode@{c e g@}
but instead:  \chordmode @{ c e g @}
@end example

@item
Use @{ @} marks for additional @code{\markup} format commands; i.e.

@example
not:          c^\markup \tiny\sharp
but instead:  c^\markup @{ \tiny \sharp @}
@end example

@item
Remove any space around @code{<} @code{>} marks; i.e.

@example
not:           < c e g > 4
but instead:   <c e g>4
@end example

@item
Beam, slur and tie marks should begin immediately after the first
note with beam and phrase marks ending immediately after the last.

@example
a8\( ais16[ b cis( d] b) cis4~ b' cis,\)
@end example

@item
If you want to work on an example outside of the manual (for
easier/faster processing), use this header:

@example
\paper @{
  indent = 0\mm
  line-width = 160\mm - 2.0 * 0.4\in
  line-width = #(- line-width (* mm  3.000000))
@}

\layout @{
@}
@end example

You may not change any of these values.  If you are making an
example demonstrating special @code{\paper@{@}} values, contact the
Documentation Editor.

@end itemize


@node Text formatting
@subsection Text formatting

@itemize
@item
Lines should be less than 72 characters long.  (We personally
recommend writing with 66-char lines, but do not bother modifying
existing material).  Also see the recommendations for fixed-width
fonts in the @ref{Syntax survey}.

@item
Do not use tabs.

@item
Do not use spaces at the beginning of a line (except in
@code{@@example} or @code{@@verbatim} environments), and do not
use more than a single space between words.  @q{texi2any} copies
the input lines verbatim without removing those spaces.

@item
Use two spaces after a period.

@item
In examples of syntax, use @code{@@var@{@var{musicexpr}@}} for a
music expression.

@item
Don't use @code{@@rinternals@{@}} in the main text.  If you're
tempted to do so, you're probably getting too close to @qq{talking
through the code}.  If you really want to refer to a context, use
@code{@@code@{@}} in the main text and @code{@@rinternals@{@}} in
the @code{@@morerefs}.

@unnumberedsubsubsec Fixed-width font

@itemize
@item
@code{@@code@{@dots{}@}}, @code{@@samp@{@dots{}@}} ---

Use the @code{@@code@{@dots{}@}} command when referring to
individual language-specific tokens (keywords, commands,
engravers, scheme symbols, etc.@:) in the text.  Ideally, a single
@code{@@code@{@dots{}@}} block should fit within one line in the
PDF output.

Use the @code{@@samp@{@dots{}@}} command when you have a short
example of user input, unless it constitutes an entire
@code{@@item} by itself, in which case @code{@@code@{@dots{}@}} is
preferable.  Otherwise, both should only be used when part of a
larger sentence within a paragraph or @code{@@item}.  Do not use
@code{@@code@{@dots{}@}} or @code{@@samp@{@dots{}@}} inside an
@code{@@example} block, and do not use either as a free-standing
paragraph; use @code{@@example} instead.

A single unindented line in the PDF has space for about 79
fixed-width characters (76 if indented).  Within an @code{@@item}
there is space for about 75 fixed-width characters.  Each
additional level of @code{@@itemize} or @code{@@enumerate}
shortens the line by about 4 columns.

However, even short blocks of @code{@@code@{@dots{}@}} and
@code{@@samp@{@dots{}@}} can run into the margin if the Texinfo
line-breaking algorithm gets confused.  Additionally, blocks that
are longer than this may in fact print nicely; it all depends
where the line breaks end up.  If you compile the docs yourself,
check the PDF output to make sure the line breaks are
satisfactory.

The Texinfo setting @code{@@allowcodebreaks} is set to
@code{false} in the manuals, so lines within
@code{@@code@{@dots{}@}} or @code{@@samp@{@dots{}@}} blocks will
only break at spaces, not at hyphens or underscores.  If the block
contains spaces, use @code{@@w@{@@code@{@dots{}@}@}} or
@code{@@w@{@@samp@{@dots{}@}@}} to prevent unexpected line breaks.

The Texinfo settings @code{txicodequoteundirected} and
@code{txicodequotebacktick} are both set in the manuals, so
backticks (@code{`}) and apostrophes (@code{'}) placed within
blocks of @code{@@code}, @code{@@example}, or @code{@@verbatim}
are not converted to left- and right-angled quotes
(@code{@quoteleft{} @quoteright{}}) as they normally are within
the text, so the apostrophes in
@q{@w{@code{@@w@{@@code@{\relative c''@}@}}}} will display
correctly.  However, these settings do not affect the PDF output
for anything within a @code{@@samp} block (even if it includes a
nested @code{@@code} block), so entering
@q{@code{@@w@{@@samp@{\relative c''@}@}}} wrongly produces
@q{@w{@code{\relative c@quoteright{}@quoteright{}}}} in PDF.
Consequently, if you want to use a @code{@@samp@{@dots{}@}} block
which contains backticks or apostrophes, you should instead use
@q{@code{@@q@{@@code@{@dots{}@}@}}} (or
@q{@code{@@q@{@@w@{@@code@{@dots{}@}@}@}}} if the block also
contains spaces).

@item
@code{@@command@{@dots{}@}} --- Use when referring to command-line
commands within the text (eg. @samp{@@command@{convert-ly@}}).  Do
not use inside an @code{@@example} block.

@item
@code{@@example} --- Use for examples of program code.  Do not add
extraneous indentation (i.e., don't start every line with
whitespace).  Use the following layout (notice the use of blank
lines).  Omit the @code{@@noindent} if the text following the
example starts a new paragraph:

@example
@var{@dots{}text leading into the example@dots{}}

@@example
@dots{}
@@end example

@@noindent
@var{continuation of the text@dots{}}
@end example

Individual lines within an @code{@@example} block should not
exceed 74 characters; otherwise they will run into the margin in
the PDF output, and may get clipped.  If an @code{@@example} block
is part of an @code{@@item}, individual lines in the
@code{@@example} block should not exceed 70 columns.  Each
additional level of @code{@@itemize} or @code{@@enumerate}
shortens the line by about 4 columns.

For long command-line examples, if possible, use a trailing
backslash to break up a single line, indenting the next line with
2 spaces.  If this isn't feasible, use @samp{@@smallexample
@dots{} @@end@tie{}smallexample} instead, which uses a smaller
fontsize.  Use @code{@@example} whenever possible, but if needed,
@code{@@smallexample} can fit up to 90 characters per line before
running into the PDF margin.  Each additional level of
@code{@@itemize} or @code{@@enumerate} shortens a
@code{@@smallexample} line by about 5 columns.

@item
@code{@@file@{@dots{}@}} --- Use when referring to file names and
directories in the text.  Do not use inside an @code{@@example}
block.

@item
@code{@@option@{@dots{}@}} --- Use when referring to command-line
options in the text (eg. @samp{@@option@{--format@}}).  Do not use
inside an @code{@@example} block.

@item
@code{@@verbatim} --- Prints the block exactly as it appears in
the source file (including whitespace, etc.).  For program code
examples, use @code{@@example} instead.  @code{@@verbatim} uses
the same format as @code{@@example}.

Individual lines within an @code{@@verbatim} block should not
exceed 74 characters; otherwise they will run into the margin in
the PDF output, and may get clipped.  If an @code{@@verbatim}
block is part of an @code{@@item}, individual lines in the
@code{@@verbatim} block should not exceed 70 columns.  Each
additional level of @code{@@itemize} or @code{@@enumerate}
shortens the line by about 4 columns.

@node Indexing
@unnumberedsubsubsec Indexing

Use the following two commands.

@itemize
@item
@code{@@cindex @dots{}} --- for the general index
@item
@code{@@funindex @dots{}} --- for commands and properties like
@code{\bar} or @code{left-@/margin}
@end itemize

Here are some rules how index entries should look like.

@itemize
@item
Only capitalize the first word of a @code{@@cindex} entry if you
would do so in the middle of an English sentence.  Examples:

@example
@@cindex ancient clef
@@cindex Kievan clef
@end example

@code{@@funindex} entries are written as-is; don't omit the
leading backslash if there is one.

@item
Use singular forms as much as possible.  After a comma, use
whatever looks better.  Examples:

@example
@@cindex clef
@@cindex fingering instruction, for chords
@end example

@item
Permute index entries if it makes sense.  Example:

@example
@@cindex ancient note head
@@cindex note head, ancient
@end example

@item
Try to make entries fit into groups so that the printed index
looks like this:

@example
@dots{}
text, framing
text, horizontal alignment
text, in columns
text, in volta bracket
text, justified
@dots{}
@end example

@item
Don't insert @code{@@funindex@{\foo@}} and @code{@@cindex@{\foo@}}
simultaneously.

@item
If both @code{foo} and @code{\foo} need to be indexed with
@code{@@funindex} you have to use the @code{@@funindexpre} or
@code{@@funindexpost} command: @code{@@funindexpre foo} gets
sorted before @code{@@funindex \foo}, and @code{@@funindexpost
\foo} gets sorted after @code{@@funindex foo}.  Example:

@example
@@funindex [
@@funindexpost \[
@end example

@item
If you mention entities in a @code{@@cindex} entry that would
normally be entered with @code{@@funindex}, use @code{@@code} to
mark them.  Example:

@example
@@cindex @@code@{\context@}, in @@code@{\layout@} block
@end example

@item
To get a literal @samp{@{} or @samp{@}} in an index, write
@code{@@@{} and @code{@@@}}, respectively.

@item
As of November 2022, if an index entry starts with an accented
character, use a Texinfo accent macro instead of the real
character.  For example, an index entry for @q{Äolisch} should be
entered as

@example
@@cindex @@"Aolisch
@end example

@noindent
to circumvent a problem with @command{texindex} (used by Texinfo
to sort and unify index entries in PDF output): This program
currently has no support for locale-specific collation.  In the
above example, the entry is now sorted as @q{Aolisch}.

In case this is not sufficient it is always possible to explicitly
specify a sorting key using the @code{@@sortas} command: Assuming
that entries starting with letter @q{ä} must be sorted after all
entries starting with letter @q{a}, writing

@example
@@cindex @@sortas@{azzzAolisch@} Äolisch
@end example

@noindent
would make this work.  Unfortunately, this trick doesn't create an
initial letter in the printed index for entries starting with
@q{Ä}.

@node Lists
@unnumberedsubsubsec Lists

@itemize
@item
@code{@@enumerate} --- Create an ordered list (with numbers).
Always put @samp{@@item} on its own line.  As an exception, if all
the items in the list are short enough to fit on single lines, placing
them on the @samp{@@item} lines is also permissible.  @samp{@@item}
and @samp{@@end@tie{}enumerate} should always be preceded by a blank
line.

@example
@@enumerate

@@item
A long multi-line item like this one must begin
on a line of its own and all the other items in
the list must do so too.

@@item
Even short ones

@@end enumerate
@end example

@example
@@enumerate

@@item Short item

@@item Short item

@@end enumerate
@end example

@item

the same format as @code{@@enumerate}.  Do not use
@samp{@@itemize@tie{}@@bullet}.

@node Special characters
@unnumberedsubsubsec Special characters

@warning{In Texinfo, the backslash is an ordinary character, and
is entered without escaping (e.g.
@samp{The@tie{}@@code@{@bs{}foo@}@tie{}command}).  However, within
double-quoted Scheme and/or LilyPond strings, backslashes
(including those ending up in Texinfo markup) need to be escaped
by doubling them:
@example
(define (foo x)
  "The @@code@{@bs{}@bs{}foo@} command..."
  ...)
@end example
}

@itemize
@item
@code{--}, @code{---} --- Create an en dash (--) or an em dash
(---) in the text.  To print two or three literal hyphens in a
row, wrap one of them in a @code{@@w@{@dots{}@}} (eg.
@samp{-@@w@{-@}-}).

@item
@code{@@@@}, @code{@@@{}, @code{@@@}} --- Create an at-sign (@@),
a left curly bracket (@{), or a right curly bracket (@}).

@item
@code{@@tie@{@}} --- Create a @emph{variable-width} non-breaking
space in the text (use @w{@samp{@@w@{ @}}} for a single
@emph{fixed-width} non-breaking space).  Variables or numbers
which consist of a single character (probably followed by a
punctuation mark) should be tied properly, either to the previous
or the next word.  Example: @samp{The letter@@tie@{@}@@q@{I@} is
skipped}
@end itemize


@node Miscellany
@unnumberedsubsubsec Miscellany

@itemize
@item
@code{@@notation@{@dots{}@}} --- refers to pieces of notation, e.g.
@samp{@@notation@{clef@}}.  Also use for specific lyrics
(@samp{the @@notation@{A@tie{}-@tie{}men@} is centered}).
Only use once per subsection per term.

@item
@code{@@q@{@dots{}@}} --- Single quotes.  Used for
@quoteleft{}vague@quoteright{} terms.

@item
@code{@@qq@{@dots{}@}} --- Double quotes.  Used for actual quotes
(@qq{he said}) or for introducing special input modes.

@item
@code{@@var@{@dots{}@}} --- Use for metasyntactic variables (such
as @code{@var{foo}}, @code{@var{bar}}, @code{@var{arg1}}, etc.).
In most cases, when the @code{@@var@{@dots{}@}} command appears in
the text (and not in an @code{@@example} block) it should be
wrapped with an appropriate texinfo code-highlighting command
(such as @code{@@code}, @code{@@samp}, @code{@@file},
@code{@@command}, etc.).  For example:
@samp{@@code@{@@var@{foo@}@}},
@samp{@@file@{@@var@{myfile.ly@}@}},
@w{@samp{@@samp@{git switch @@var@{branch@}@}}}, etc.  This
improves readability in the PDF and HTML output.

@item
@code{@@version@{@}} --- Return the current LilyPond version
string.  Use @samp{@@w@{@@version@{@}@}} if it's at the end of a
line (to prevent an ugly line break in PDF); use
@samp{@@w@{"@@version@{@}"@}} if you need it in quotes.

@item
@code{@@w@{@dots{}@}} --- Do not allow any line breaks.

@item
@code{@@warning@{@dots{}@}} --- produces a @qq{Note:@tie{}} box.
Use for important messages.

@node Other text concerns
@subsection Other text concerns

@itemize
@item
References must occur at the end of a sentence, for more
information see the
@uref{https://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/manual/texinfo/,texinfo
manual}.  Ideally this should also be the final sentence of a
paragraph, but this is not required.  Any link in a doc section
must be duplicated in the @code{@@morerefs} section at the bottom.

@item
Introducing examples must be done with

@example
. (i.e., finish the previous sentence/paragraph)
: (i.e., 'in this example:')
, (i.e., 'may add foo with the blah construct,')
@end example

The old @qq{sentence runs directly into the example} method is not
allowed any more.

@item
Abbrevs in caps, e.g., HTML, DVI, MIDI, etc.

@item
Colon usage

@enumerate
@item
To introduce lists

@item
When beginning a quote: @qq{So, he said,...}.

This usage is rarer.  Americans often just use a comma.

@item
When adding a defining example at the end of a sentence.
@end enumerate

@item
Non-ASCII characters which are in utf-8 should be directly used;
this is, don't say @samp{Ba@@ss@{@}tuba} but @samp{Baßtuba}.  This
ensures that all such characters appear in all output formats.

@node Books
@subsection Books

There are four parts to the documentation: the Learning Manual,
the Notation Reference, the Program Reference, and the Music
Glossary.

@itemize

@item
Learning Manual:

The LM is written in a tutorial style which introduces the most
important concepts, structure and syntax of the elements of a
LilyPond score in a carefully graded sequence of steps.
Explanations of all musical concepts used in the Manual can be
found in the Music Glossary, and readers are assumed to have no
prior knowledge of LilyPond.  The objective is to take readers to
a level where the Notation Reference can be understood and
employed to both adapt the templates in the Appendix to their
needs and to begin to construct their own scores.  Commonly used
tweaks are introduced and explained.  Examples are provided
throughout which, while being focussed on the topic being
introduced, are long enough to seem real in order to retain the
readers' interest.  Each example builds on the previous material,
and comments are used liberally.  Every new aspect is thoroughly
explained before it is used.

Users are encouraged to read the complete Learning Manual from
start-to-finish.


@item
Notation Reference: a (hopefully complete) description of LilyPond
input notation.  Some material from here may be duplicated in the
Learning Manual (for teaching), but consider the NR to be the
"definitive" description of each notation element, with the LM
being an "extra".  The goal is _not_ to provide a step-by-step
learning environment -- do not avoid using notation that has not
be introduced previously in the NR  (for example, use \break if
appropriate).  This section is written in formal technical writing
style.

Avoid duplication.  Although users are not expected to read this
manual from start to finish, they should be familiar with the
material in the Learning Manual (particularly @qq{Fundamental
Concepts}), so do not repeat that material in each section of
this book.  Also watch out for common constructs, like ^ - _ for
directions -- those are explained in NR 3.  In NR 1, you can
write: DYNAMICS may be manually placed above or below the staff,
see @@ref@{Controlling direction and placement@}.

Most tweaks should be added to LSR and not placed directly in the
@file{.itely} file.  In some cases, tweaks may be placed in the main
text, but ask about this first.

Finally, you should assume that users know what the notation
means; explaining musical concepts happens in the Music Glossary.


@item
Application Usage: information about using the program lilypond
with other programs (lilypond-book, operating systems, GUIs,
convert-ly, etc).  This section is written in formal technical
writing style.

Users are not expected to read this manual from start to finish.


@item
Music Glossary: information about the music notation itself.
Explanations and translations about notation terms go here.

Users are not expected to read this manual from start to finish.

@item
Internals Reference: not really a documentation book, since it is
automagically generated from the source, but this is its name.

("Snippets" is REQUIRED; the others are optional)

@item
Any new concepts or links which require an explanation should go
as a full sentence(s) in the main text.

@item
Don't insert an empty line between @@morerefs and the first entry!
Otherwise there is excessive vertical space in the PDF output.

@end itemize

@item
To create links, use @@ref@{@} if the link is within the same
manual.

@item
@@predefined ... @@endpredefined is for commands in
@file{ly/*-init.ly}

@item
Do not include any real info in second-level sections (i.e. 1.1
Pitches).  A first-level section may have introductory material,
but other than that all material goes into third-level sections
(i.e. 1.1.1 Writing Pitches).

@item
The @@knownissues should not discuss any issues that are in the
tracker, unless the issue is Priority-Postponed.  The goal is to
discuss any overall architecture or syntax decisions which may be
interpreted as bugs.  Normal bugs should not be discussed here,
because we have so many bugs that it would be a huge task to keep
the @@knownissues current and accurate all the time.

@end itemize


@node Checking cross-references
@subsection Checking cross-references

Cross-references between different manuals are heavily used in the
documentation, but they are not checked during compilation.
However, if you compile the documentation, a script called
check_texi_refs can help you with checking and fixing these
cross-references; for information on usage, cd into a source tree
where documentation has been built, cd into Documentation and run:

@example
make check-xrefs
make fix-xrefs
@end example

Note that you have to find yourself the source files to fix
cross-references in the generated documentation such as the
Internals Reference; e.g., you can grep scm/ and lily/.


@node General writing
@subsection General writing

@itemize

@item
Do not forget to create @@cindex entries for new sections of text.
Enter commands with @@funindex, i.e.

@example
@@cindex pitches, writing in different octaves
@@funindex \relative
@end example

@noindent
Do not bother with the @@code@{@} (they are added automatically).
These items are added to both the command index and the unified
index.  Both index commands should go in front of the actual material.

@item
@@cindex entries should not be capitalized, i.e.

@example
@@cindex time signature
@end example

@noindent
is preferred instead of @qq{Time signature}.  Only use capital
letters for musical terms which demand them, e.g.,
@qq{D.S. al Fine}.

@item
For scheme function index entries, only include the final part, i.e.

@example
@@funindex modern-voice-cautionary
     and NOT
@@funindex #(set-accidental-style modern-voice-cautionary)
@end example

@item
Use American spelling.  LilyPond's internal property
names use this convention.

@item
Here is a list of preferred terms to be used:

@itemize
@item
@emph{Simultaneous} NOT concurrent.

@item
@emph{Measure}: the unit of music.

@item
@emph{Bar line}: the symbol delimiting a measure NOT barline.

@item
@emph{Note head} NOT notehead.

@item
@emph{Chord construct} NOT just chord (when referring to < ... >)

@item
@emph{Staff} NOT stave.

@item
@emph{Staves} NOT Staffs:
Phrases such as
@q{multiple @@internalsref@{Staff@}s}
should be rephrased to
@q{multiple @@internalsref@{Staff@} contexts}.

@end itemize

@node Technical writing style
@subsection Technical writing style

These refer to the NR.  The LM uses a more gentle, colloquial
style.

@itemize

@item
Do not refer to LilyPond in the text.  The reader knows what the
manual is about.  If you do, capitalization is LilyPond.

@item
If you explicitly refer to @q{lilypond} the program (or any other
command to be executed), write @code{@@command@{lilypond@}}.

@item
Do not explicitly refer to the reader/user.  There is no one else
besides the reader and the writer.

@item
Avoid contractions (don't, won't, etc.).  Spell the words out completely.

@item
Avoid abbreviations, except for commonly used abbreviations of foreign
language terms such as @q{etc.@:} and @q{i.e.}.

@item
Avoid fluff (@qq{Notice that,} @qq{as you can see,}
@qq{Currently,}).

@item
The use of the word @q{illegal} is inappropriate in most cases.
Say @q{invalid} instead.

@end itemize


@node Tips for writing docs
@section Tips for writing docs

In the NR, I highly recommend focusing on one subsection at a
time.  For each subsection,

@itemize

@item
check the mundane formatting.  Are the headings (@@predefined,
@@morerefs, etc.@:) in the right order?

@item
add any appropriate index entries.

@item
check the links in the @@morerefs section -- links to music
glossary, internal references, and other NR sections are the main
concern.  Check for potential additions.

@item
move LSR-worthy material into LSR.  Add the snippet, delete the
material from the @file{.itely} file, and add a @@lilypondfile command.

@item
check the examples and descriptions.  Do they still work?
@strong{Do not} assume that the existing text is
accurate/complete; some of the manual is highly out of date.

@item
is the material in the @@knownissues  still accurate?

@item
can the examples be improved (made more explanatory), or is there
any missing info?  (feel free to ask specific questions on -user;
a couple of people claimed to be interesting in being
@qq{consultants} who would help with such questions)

@end itemize

In general, I favor short text explanations with good examples --
@qq{an example is worth a thousand words}.  When I worked on the
docs, I spent about half my time just working on those tiny
lilypond examples.  Making easily-understandable examples is much
harder than it looks.


@subsubheading Tweaks

In general, any \set or \override commands should go in the
@qq{select snippets} section, which means that they should go in
LSR and not the @file{.itely} file.  For some cases, the command
obviously belongs in the @qq{main text} (i.e., not inside
@@predefined or @@morerefs or whatever) -- instrument names are a
good example of this.

@example
\set Staff.instrumentName = "foo"
@end example

On the other side of this,

@example
\override Score.Hairpin.after-line-breaking = ##t
@end example

clearly belongs in LSR.

I'm quite willing to discuss specific cases if you think that a
tweaks needs to be in the main text.  But items that can go into
LSR are easier to maintain, so I'd like to move as much as
possible into there.


It would be @qq{nice} if you spent a lot of time crafting nice
tweaks for users@dots{} but my recommendation is @strong{not} to do
this.  There's a lot of doc work to do without adding examples of
tweaks.  Tweak examples can easily be added by normal users by adding
them to the LSR.

One place where a documentation writer can profitably spend time writing
or upgrading tweaks is creating tweaks to deal with known issues.  It
would be ideal if every significant known issue had a workaround to avoid
the difficulty.

@node Building only one section of the documentation
@unnumberedsubsubsec Building only one section of the documentation

In order to save build time, a script is available to build only
one section of the documentation in English with a default HTML
appearance.

If you do not yet have a @file{build/} subdirectory within the LilyPond
Git tree, you should create this first.  You can then build a section of
the documentation with the following command:

@example
scripts/auxiliar/doc-section.sh MANUAL SECTION
@end example

@noindent
where @code{SECTION} is the name of the file containing the section
to be built, and @code{MANUAL} is replaced by the name of the directory
containing the section.  So, for example, to build section 1.1 of the
Notation Reference, use the command:

@example
scripts/auxiliar/doc-section.sh notation pitches
@end example

You can then see the generated document for the section at

@example
build/tempdocs/pitches/out/pitches.html
@end example

According to
@uref{https://sourceforge.net/p/testlilyissues/issues/1236/,LilyPond issue 1236},
the location of the LilyPond Git tree is taken from @code{$LILYPOND_GIT}
if specified, otherwise it is auto-detected.

It is assumed that compilation takes place in the @file{build/}
subdirectory, but this can be overridden by setting the environment
variable @code{LILYPOND_BUILD_DIR}.

Similarly, output defaults to @file{build/tempdocs/} but this can be
overridden by setting the environment variable
@code{LILYPOND_TEMPDOCS}.

This script will not work for building sections of the
Contributors' Guide.  For building sections of the Contributors'
Guide, use:

@example
scripts/auxiliar/cg-section.sh SECTION
@end example

@noindent
where @code{SECTION} is the name of the file containing the sections
to be built.  For example, to build section 4 of the Contributors' Guide,
use:

@example
scripts/auxiliar/cg-section.sh doc-work
@end example

@code{cg-section.sh} uses the same environment variables and
corresponding default values as @code{doc-section.sh}.

Material in the Internals reference is generated automatically

Most documentation writers never touch these, though.  If you want
to work on them, please ask for help.

@node Translation requirements
@unnumberedsubsubsec Translation requirements

Working on LilyPond documentation translations requires the following
pieces of software, in order to make use of dedicated helper tools:

@itemize
@item Python 3.8 or higher,
@item GNU Make,
@item Gettext,
@item Git.
@end itemize

It is not required to build LilyPond and the documentation to
translate the documentation.  However, if you have enough time and
motivation and a suitable system, it can be very useful to build at
least the documentation so that you can check the output yourself and
more quickly; if you are interested, see @ref{Compiling}.

Before undertaking any large translation work, contributors are
encouraged to contact the @code{lilypond-devel} mailing list.

@node Which documentation can be translated
@unnumberedsubsubsec Which documentation can be translated

The makefiles and scripts infrastructure currently supports translation
of the following documentation:

@itemize
@item the web site, the Learning Manual, the Notation Reference and
Application Usage -- Texinfo source, PDF and HTML output; Info output
might be added if there is enough demand for it;
@item the Changes document.
@end itemize

Support for translating the following pieces of documentation should be
added soon, by decreasing order of priority:

@itemize
@item automatically generated documentation: markup commands,
predefined music functions;
@item the Snippets List;
@item the Internals Reference.
@end itemize


@node Starting translation in a new language
@unnumberedsubsubsec Starting translation in a new language

At top of the source directory, do

@example
./autogen.sh
@end example

@noindent
or (if you want to install your self-compiled LilyPond locally)

@example
./autogen.sh --prefix=$HOME
@end example

@noindent
If you want to compile LilyPond -- which is almost required to build
the documentation, but is not required to do translation only -- fix
all dependencies and rerun @command{./configure} (with the same
options as for @command{autogen.sh}).

Then @command{cd} into @file{Documentation/} and run

@example
make ISOLANG=@var{MY-LANGUAGE} new-lang
@end example

@noindent
where @var{MY-LANGUAGE} is the ISO 639 language code.

Finally, add a language definition for your language in
@file{python/langdefs.py},
@file{Documentation/lilypond-lang.init} and
@file{Documentation/webserver/lilypond.org.htaccess}.
Add this language definition and the corresponding section in
@file{Documentation/lilypond.init} and
@file{scripts/build/create-weblinks-itexi.py}.

Translation of @file{Documentation/en/foo/bar} should be

Files of priority 1 should be submitted along all files generated
by starting a new language in the same commit and thus a unique
patch, and the translation of files marked with priority 2 should
be committed to Git at the same time and thus sent in a single
patch.  Priority 1 files are required before requesting a
language-specific mailing list @code{lilypond-xyz@@gnu.org}.
Files marked with priority 3 or more may be submitted
individually.  For knowing how to commit your work to Git, then
make patches of your new translations as well as corrections and

@node Translating the Web site and other Texinfo documentation
@unnumberedsubsubsec Translating the Web site and other Texinfo documentation

Every piece of text should be translated in the source file, except
Texinfo comments, text in @code{@@lilypond} blocks and a few cases
mentioned below.

Node names are not translated, only the section titles are.
That is, every piece in the original file like

@example
@@node Foo bar
@@@var{section_command} Bar baz
@end example

@noindent
should be translated as

@example
@@node Foo bar
@@@var{section_command} @var{translation of Bar baz}
@end example

The argument of @code{@@rglos} commands and the first argument of
@code{@@rglosnamed} commands must not be translated, as it is the node
name of an entry in Music Glossary.

Every time you translate a node name in a cross-reference, i.e., the
argument of commands @code{@@ref, @@rprogram, @@rlearning, @@rlsr,
@@rnotation} or the first argument of their @code{@var{*}named} variants,
you should make sure the target node is defined in the correct source
file; if you do not intend to translate the target node right now, you
should at least write the node definition in the
expected source file and define all its parent nodes; for each node you
have defined this way but have not translated, insert a line that
contains @code{@@untranslated}.  That is, you should end up
for each untranslated node with something like

@example
@@node Foo bar
@@@var{section_command} @var{translation of Bar baz}

@@untranslated
@end example

@warning{you do not have to translate the node name of a cross-reference
to a node that you do not have translated.  If you do, you must define
an @qq{empty} node like explained just above; this will produce a
cross-reference with the translated node name in output, although the
target node will still be in English.  On the opposite, if all
cross-references that refer to an untranslated node use the node name in
English, then you do not have to define such an @qq{empty} node, and the
cross-reference text will appear in English in the output.  The choice
between these two strategies implies its particular maintenance
requirements and is left to the translators, although the opinion of the
Translation meister leans towards not translating these
cross-references.}

Please think of the fact that it may not make sense translating
everything in some Texinfo files, and you may take distance from the
original text; for instance, in the translation of the web site section
Community, you may take this into account depending on what you know the
community in your language is willing to support, which is possible only
if you personally assume this support, or there exists a public forum
or mailing list listed in Community for LilyPond in your language:

@itemize
@item @rweb{Bug reports}: this page should be translated only if you
know that every bug report sent on your language's mailing list or forum
will be handled by someone who will translate it to English and send it
on bug-lilypond or add an issue in the tracker, then translate back the
reply from developers.

@item @rweb{Help us}: this page should be translated very freely,
and possibly not at all: ask help for contributing to LilyPond for tasks
that LilyPond community in your language is able and going to handle.
@end itemize

@noindent
In any case, please mark in your work the sections which do not result
from the direct translation of a piece of English translation, using
comments i.e., lines starting with @q{@code{@@c}}.

Finally, press in Emacs @key{C-c C-u C-a} to update or generate
menus.  This process should be made easier in the future, when the helper
script @command{texi-langutils.py} and the makefile target are updated.

Some pieces of text manipulated by build scripts that appear in the
output are translated in a @file{.po} file -- just like LilyPond output
messages -- in @file{Documentation/po}.  The Gettext domain is named
@code{lilypond-doc}, and unlike @code{lilypond} domain it is not managed
through the Free Translation Project.


Take care of using typographic rules for your language, especially in
@file{macros.itexi}.

If you wonder whether a word, phrase or larger piece of text should be
translated, whether it is an argument of a Texinfo command or a small
piece sandwiched between two Texinfo commands, try to track whether and
where it appears in PDF and/or HTML output as visible text.  This piece
of advice is especially useful for translating @file{macros.itexi}.

Please keep verbatim copies of music snippets (in @code{@@lilypond}
blocks).  However, some music snippets containing text that shows in
the rendered music, and sometimes translating this text really helps
the user to understand the documentation; in this case, and only in
this case, you may as an exception translate text in the music
snippet, and then you must add a line immediately before the
@code{@@lilypond} block, starting with

@example
@@c KEEP LY
@end example

@noindent
Otherwise the music snippet would be reset to the same content as the
English version at next @command{make snippet-update} run -- see
@ref{Updating documentation translation}.

When you encounter

@example
@@lilypondfile[<number of fragment options>,texidoc]@{@var{filename.ly}@}
@end example

@noindent
in the source, open @file{Documentation/snippets/@var{filename}.ly},
translate the @code{texidoc} header field it contains, enclose it with
@code{texidoc@var{MY-LANGUAGE} = "} and @code{"}, and write it into
@file{Documentation/@var{MY-LANGUAGE}/texidocs/@/@var{filename}.texidoc}.
Additionally, you may translate the snippet's title in @code{doctitle}
header field, in case @code{doctitle} is a fragment option used in
@code{@@lilypondfile}; you can do this exactly the same way as
@code{texidoc}.  For instance,
@file{Documentation/@var{MY-LANGUAGE}/texidocs/@/@var{filename}.texidoc}
may contain

@example
doctitlees = "Spanish title baz"
texidoces = "
Spanish translation blah
"
@end example

@code{@@example} blocks need not be verbatim copies, e.g., variable
names, file names and comments should be translated.

Finally, please carefully apply every rule exposed in @ref{Texinfo
introduction and usage policy}, and @ref{Documentation policy}.  If one
of these rules conflicts with a rule specific to your language, please
ask the Translation meister and/or the Documentation Editors on
@email{lilypond-devel@@gnu.org} list.


@node Adding a Texinfo manual
@unnumberedsubsubsec Adding a Texinfo manual

In order to start translating a new manual, simply copy the English files within
your language directory and translate them.

For example, if you want to translate the first chapter of the Learning Manual:

@example
cp Documentation/en/learning.tely Documentation/@var{LANG}/learning.tely
cp Documentation/en/learning/tutorial.itely Documentation/@var{LANG}/tutorial.itely
@end example


@node Documentation translation maintenance
@subsection Documentation translation maintenance

Several tools have been developed to make translations maintenance
easier.  These helper scripts make use of the power of Git, the
version control system used for LilyPond development.

You should use them whenever you would like to update the translation in
your language, which you may do at the frequency that fits your and your
cotranslators' respective available times.  In the case your translation
is up-to-date (which you can discover in the first subsection below), it
is enough to check its state every one or two weeks.  If you feel
overwhelmed by the quantity of documentation to be updated, see
@ref{Maintaining without updating translations}.

@menu
* Check state of translation::
* Updating documentation translation::
* Updating translation committishes::
* Maintaining without updating translations::
@end menu

@macro seeCommittishesUpdate{}
@warning{do not forget to update the committish in each file you have
completely updated, see @ref{Updating translation committishes}.}
@end macro

@node Check state of translation
@unnumberedsubsubsec Check state of translation

@warning{Translation helper scripts will work only if you've configured
lilypond to be built in-tree, as explained in @ref{Running autogen.sh}.}

First pull from Git -- see @ref{Git cheat sheet}, but DO NOT rebase
unless you are sure to master the translation state checking and
updating system -- then cd into @file{Documentation/} (or at top of the
source tree, replace @command{make} with @command{make -C
Documentation}) and run

@example
make ISOLANG=@var{MY_LANGUAGE} check-translation
@end example

@noindent
This presents a diff of the original files since the most recent
revision of the translation and prints it to terminal output.
Usually you'll want to pass this output to a terminal pager
like @command{less} in order to scroll the diff up and down:

@example
make ISOLANG=@var{MY_LANGUAGE} check-translation | less -R
@end example

To check a single file, cd into @file{Documentation/} and run

@example
make TRANSLATION_FILES=@var{MY_LANGUAGE}/@var{manual}/@var{foo}.itely check-translation
@end example

@noindent
In case this file has been renamed since you last updated the
translation, you should specify both old and new file names, e.g.
@code{TRANSLATION_FILES=@var{MY_LANGUAGE}/@{@var{manual},user@}/@var{foo}.itely}.

To see only which files need to be updated, do

@example
make ISOLANG=@var{MY_LANGUAGE} check-translation | grep -n 'diff --git'
@end example

The @code{-n} option of @command{grep} will print the line number of each
occurrence, which can be used to have an idea of the length of each diff
and the amount of work required.

To avoid printing terminal colors control characters, which is often
desirable when you redirect output to a file, run

@example
make ISOLANG=@var{MY_LANGUAGE} NO_COLOR=1 check-translation
@end example

You can see the diffs generated by the commands above as changes that
you should make in your language to the existing translation, in order
to make your translation up to date.

@node Updating documentation translation
@unnumberedsubsubsec Updating documentation translation

Instead of running @code{check-translation}, you may want to run
@code{update-translation}, which will run your favorite text editor to
update files.  First, make sure environment variable @code{EDITOR} is
set to a text editor command, then run from @file{Documentation/}

@example
make ISOLANG=@var{MY_LANGUAGE} update-translation
@end example

@noindent
or to update a single file

@example
make TRANSLATION_FILES=@var{MY_LANGUAGE/@var{manual}/foo.itely} update-translation
@end example

For each file to be updated, @code{update-translation} will open your
text editor with this file and a diff of the file in English; if the
diff cannot be generated or is bigger than the file in English itself,
the full file in English will be opened instead.

@seeCommittishesUpdate

@file{.po} message catalogs in @file{Documentation/po/} may be updated
by issuing from @file{Documentation/} or @file{Documentation/po/}

@example
make po-update
@end example

@warning{if you run po-update and somebody else does the same and
pushes before you push or send a patch to be applied, there will be a
conflict when you pull.  Therefore, it is better that only the
Translation meister runs this command. Furthermore, it has been borken
since the GDP: variable names and comments do no longer appear as
translated.}

Updating music snippets can quickly become cumbersome, as most
snippets should be identical in all languages.  Fortunately, there is
a script that can do this odd job for you (run from
@file{Documentation/}):

@example
make ISOLANG=@var{MY_LANGUAGE} snippet-update
@end example

This script overwrites music snippets in
@file{@var{MY_LANGUAGE/foo/every.itely}} with music snippets from
@file{@var{foo/every.itely}}.  It ignores skeleton files, and keeps
intact music snippets preceded with a line starting with @code{@@c
KEEP LY}; it reports an error for each @file{.itely} that has not the
same music snippet count in both languages.  Always use this script
with a lot of care, i.e., run it on a clean Git working tree, and check
the changes it made with @command{git diff} before committing; if you
don't do so, some @code{@@lilypond} snippets might be broken or make
no sense in their context.

@node Updating translation committishes
@unnumberedsubsubsec Updating translation committishes

At the beginning of each translated file except PO files, there is a
committish which represents the revision of the sources which you have
used to translate this file from the file in English.

When you have pulled and updated a translation, it is very important to
update this committish in the files you have completely updated (and
only these); to do this, first commit possible changes to any
documentation in English which you are sure to have done in your
translation as well, then replace in the up-to-date translated files the
old committish by the committish of latest commit, which can be obtained
by doing

@example
git rev-list HEAD |head -1
@end example

@c http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/lilypond-devel/2009-01/msg00245.html
@c contains a helper script which could be used to perform massive
@c committish updates.

Most of the changes in the LSR snippets included in the documentation concern
the syntax, not the description inside @code{texidoc=""}.  This implies that
quite often you will have to update only the committish of the matching
.texidoc file.  This can be a tedious work if there are many snippets to be
marked as up do date.  You can use the following command to update the
committishes at once:

@example
cd Documentation/LANG/texidocs
sed -i -r 's/[0-9a-z]@{40@}/NEW-COMMITTISH/' *.texidoc
@end example

@endmorerefs


@node Maintaining without updating translations
@unnumberedsubsubsec Maintaining without updating translations

Keeping translations up to date under heavy changes in the documentation
in English may be almost impossible, especially when a lot of
contributors brings changes.

It is possible --- and even recommended --- to perform some maintenance
that keeps translated documentation usable and eases future translation
updating.  The rationale below the tasks list motivates this plan.

The following tasks are listed in decreasing priority order.

@enumerate
@item Update macros.itexi.
For each obsolete macro definition, if it is possible to update macro
usage in documentation with an automatic text or regexp substitution,
do it and delete the macro definition from @file{macros.itexi}; otherwise,
mark this macro definition as obsolete with a comment, and keep it in
@file{macros.itexi} until the documentation translation has been updated and
no longer uses this macro.

@item Update @file{*.tely} files completely with
@command{make check-translation} -- you may want to redirect output
to a file because of overwhelming output, or call check-translation.py
on individual files, see @ref{Check state of translation}.

@item In @file{.itelys}, match sections and .itely file names with those from
English docs, which possibly involves moving nodes contents in block
between files, without updating contents itself.  In other words, the
game is catching where has gone each section.  In Learning manual, and
in Notation Reference sections which have been revised in GDP, there may
be completely new sections: in this case, copy @code{@@node} and
@code{@@section}-command from English docs, and add the marker for
untranslated status @code{@@untranslated} on a single line.  Note that
it is not possible to exactly match subsections or subsubsections of
documentation in English, when contents has been deeply revised; in this
case, keep obsolete (sub)subsections in the translation, marking them
with a line @code{@@c obsolete} just before the node.

Emacs with Texinfo mode makes this step easier:

@itemize
@item without Emacs AucTeX installed, @key{C-c C-s} shows structure of current
Texinfo file in a new buffer @code{*Occur*}; to show structure of two files
simultaneously, first split Emacs window in 4 tiles (with @key{C-x 1}
and @key{C-x 2}), press @key{C-c C-s} to show structure of one file
(e.g., the translated file), copy @code{*Occur*} contents into
@code{*Scratch*}, then press @key{C-c C-s} for the other file.

If you happen to have installed AucTeX, you can either call the macro
by doing @key{M-x texinfo-show-structure} or create a key binding in your
@file{~/.emacs}, by adding the four following lines:

@example
(add-hook 'Texinfo-mode-hook
          '(lambda ()
             (define-key Texinfo-mode-map "\C-cs"
              'texinfo-show-structure)))
@end example

@noindent
and then obtain the structure in the @code{*Occur*} buffer with @key{C-c
s}.

@item Do not bother updating @code{@@menu}s when all menu entries are in the same
file, just do @key{C-c C-u C-a} (@qq{update all menus}) when you have
updated all the rest of the file.

@item Moving to next or previous node using incremental search: press
@key{C-s} and type @code{node} (or @key{C-s @@node} if the text
contains the word @q{node}) then press @key{C-s} to move to next node
or @key{C-r} to move to previous node.  Similar operation can be used
to move to the next/previous section.  Note that every cursor move
exits incremental search, and hitting @key{C-s} twice starts
incremental search with the text entered in previous incremental
search.

@item Moving a whole node (or even a sequence of nodes): jump to beginning
of the node (quit incremental search by pressing an arrow), press
@key{C-SPACE}, press @key{C-s node} and repeat @key{C-s} until you
have selected enough text, cut it with @key{C-w} or @key{C-x}, jump to
the right place (moving between nodes with the previous hint is often
useful) and paste with @key{C-y} or @key{C-v}.
@end itemize

@item Update sections finished in the English documentation; check
sections status at
@smallexample
@uref{https://lilypondwiki.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Documentation_coordination}.
@end smallexample

@item Update documentation PO.  It is recommended not to update
strings which come from documentation that is currently deeply revised
in English, to avoid doing the work more than once.

@item Fix broken cross-references by running (from @file{Documentation/})

@example
make ISOLANG=@var{YOUR-LANGUAGE} fix-xrefs
@end example

@noindent
This step requires a successful documentation build (with @command{make
doc}).  Some cross-references are broken because they point to a node
that exists in the documentation in English, which has not been added
to the translation; in this case, do not fix the cross-reference but
keep it "broken", so that the resulting HTML link will point to an
existing page of documentation in English.
@end enumerate

@subsubheading Rationale

You may wonder if it would not be better to leave translations as-is
until you can really start updating translations.  There are several
reasons to do these maintenance tasks right now.

@itemize
@item This will have to be done sooner or later anyway, before updating
translation of documentation contents, and this can already be done
without needing to be redone later, as sections of documentation in
English are mostly revised once.  However, note that not all
documentation sectioning has been revised in one go, so all this
maintenance plan has to be repeated whenever a big reorganization is
made.

@item This just makes translated documentation take advantage of the new
organization, which is better than the old one.

@item Moving and renaming sections to match sectioning of documentation in
English simplify future updating work: it allows updating the
translation by side-by-side comparison, without bothering whether
cross-reference names already exist in the translation.

@item Each maintenance task except @q{Updating PO files} can be done by
the same person for all languages, which saves overall time spent by
translators to achieve this task: the node names and section titles
are in English, so you can do.
@end itemize


@node Technical background
@subsection Technical background

A number of Python scripts handle a part of the documentation
translation process.  All scripts used to maintain the translations
are located in @file{scripts/auxiliar/}.

@itemize
@item @file{check_translation.py}  -- show diff to update a translation,
@item @file{texi-langutils.py}  -- quickly and dirtily parse Texinfo files to
make message catalogs and Texinfo skeleton files,
@item @file{update-snippets.py} -- synchronize ly snippets with those
from English docs,
@end itemize

Python modules used by scripts in @file{scripts/auxiliar/} or @file{scripts/build/} (but
not by installed Python scripts) are located in @file{python/auxiliar/}:
@itemize
@item @file{manuals_definitions.py} -- define manual names and name of
cross-reference Texinfo macros,
@item @file{buildlib.py} -- common functions (read piped output
of a shell command, use Git),
@item @file{postprocess_html.py} (module imported by @file{www_post.py}) -- add footer and
tweak links in HTML pages.

And finally
@itemize
@item @file{python/langdefs.py}  -- language definitions module
