@node Administrative policies
@chapter Administrative policies

This chapter discusses miscellaneous administrative issues which
don't fit anywhere else.


@node LilyPond is GNU Software
@section LilyPond is GNU Software

LilyPond is a GNU software package.  As such, it falls under the
requirements found in the
@uref{https://www.gnu.org/@/prep/@/standards/,GNU Coding
Standards}.  All suggested changes should move toward increased
compliance with these Standards.


@node Environment variables
@section Environment variables

Some maintenance scripts and instructions in this guide rely on
the following environment variables.  They should be predefined in
LilyDev distribution (see @ref{LilyDev}); if you set up your own
development environment, you can set them by appending these settings to
your @file{~/.bashrc} (or whatever defines your default environment
variables for the user account for LilyPond development), then logging
out and in (adapt directories to your setup):

@example
LILYPOND_GIT=~/lilypond-git
export LILYPOND_GIT
LILYPOND_BUILD_DIR=~/lilypond-git/build
export LILYPOND_BUILD_DIR
@end example

The standard build and install procedure (with @code{autogen.sh},
@code{configure}, @code{make}, @code{make install}, @code{make doc}
@dots{}) does not rely on them.


@node Performing yearly copyright update (grand-replace)
@section Performing yearly copyright update (@qq{grand-replace})

At the start of each year, copyright notices for all source files
should be refreshed by running the following command from the top of
the source tree:

@example
make grand-replace
@end example

Internally, this invokes the script @file{scripts/build/grand-replace.py},
which performs a regular expression substitution for old-year -> new-year
wherever it finds a valid copyright notice.

Note that snapshots of third party files such as @file{texinfo.tex} should
not be included in the automatic update; @file{grand-replace.py} ignores these
files if they are listed in the variable @code{copied_files}.
