point.  The midpoint of these is 0.75, but it is not used for the
``average'' anchor point of the group because it would fall outside
the range of anchor points that the isolated time signatures would
choose.  Instead, the average anchor point is the closer extreme of
that range, which is the center of the compound time signature.  The
arrow should point there."
